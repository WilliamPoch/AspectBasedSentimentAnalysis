review
"If it 's your first visit , you get a discount on the buffet ."
They have a variety of foods .
We also did a little bit of gambling .
Went to eat at their buffet .
"Also , the pool amenities were all closed down ."
Huge disappointment -- huge !
I did have a wonderful massage and it was a great value .
"If you would like to have the massage of your life , go see Elvira !"
Imagine our disappointment when we found the pool is shaded by the building the entire day !
Next time will stay somewhere else
She is awesome .
Stayed here because rooms were blocked for a wedding .
The restaurant offerings are limited and some of them do n't run well .
"The room itself was spacious , clean and well priced ."
The service in the restaurants was very slow .
They definitely need to move the air around better .
"We had one day for a pool day , the temperature was 94 degrees ."
We would not have stayed here if we would have known .
"When we entered , the casino was very smoky and hot ."
A Walk Back in Time
"After a few minutes , my eyes were burning ."
"Fortunately , the smell did not extend to the rooms ( but it did to the hallways ) ."
I recently stayed at the Suncoast for three nights while working on a project in Las Vegas .
I would stay away unless I had a specific reason to be in this area .
It is obvious that this property survives based on its clientele of older casino patrons .
Other negative aspects of the property are the very poor selection of TV channels and the poor set ups for working in the rooms .
The beds were fairly comfortable ( but firm ) but the pillows were very hard .
"The decor is dated ( brass fixtures everywhere ) and the casino , registration , and dining areas are like standing in a chimney ."
"The good points about this property are that it has plenty of parking ( due to the casino ) , large rooms , great views from the back of the building , and good housekeeping service ."
"There are so many people smoking in the casino , with so little ventilation , that the smell permeates almost the entire property ."
There is wireless internet but there are no power outlets near the desk or bedside tables .
"Walking into the property however , is like a journey back in time ."
I love the small size overall .
Lovely place!
"The pool is perfect , with full sun AND cabanas ."
There is a wide choice of restaurants and all are well served .
This is my third time here because I tag along while my husband is at a conference .
We saw a movie while there and had a nice choice of current movies .
"Big room , nice ( enough ) bed ... the bathroom amenities were a bit odd ( like they were the cheapest wholesale could buy ."
But this epitomizes off strip casino world .
Cheap price .
Clean .
"Hello jpm3x , We are pleased you enjoyed the service from the staff , the cleanliness of the property , and that you received a good value for the money you spent here ."
"Honestly, surprising aside from the smoky casino"
Nice enough staff .
"On your next visit , please see a property leader to discuss how we can make your next visit a five - star review ."
A very good choice in my opinion !
A very nice place to enjoy Vegas away from the Strip .
Also
Every amenity you could want or need ranging from small children to adults .
Everything you could want in a hotel and casino
"From arcades , bowling alleys , and cheap gambling ."
It is right across the street from some amazing golf courses along with shops and fine dining .
Their is everything for everyone at the Sun Coast .
Ask for a room with golf course view .
Bowling alley and game room can keep the kids entertained .
Home away from home
The price is very decent since you 're away from the strip ( about a good 15 + mins. away ) .
The rooms are clean and the staff are very friendly .
This it 's the place to stay if you just wanted to relax and not do a whole lot of activities .
A daily charge of 5 was charged to my credit card .
As far as I am concerned the refrigerator could be removed as a inclusion .
I could not believe that they do not include this courtesy for their guests .
I did n't think they would do it but I was shocked .
I do want you to know we take all comments as an informational tool to help serve our customers in a more efficient way .
I explained to the desk clerk what had happened and they could n't believe it .
I had a room that was extremely noisy and asked to be moved .
I refused to gamble there after being told about the charge for the printing of the boarding pass .
I was told they print lots of boarding passes for people as a courtesy not just guests of their hotel .
I will never dtay there again while in Vegas .
It 's the principle of the thing that matters .
It is not good PR at all .
It took them hours to get this accomplished .
My stay at the Suncoast lost its glitter when I was told I had to pay for a boarding pass to be printed .
No wonder the Republicans did n't go to the Suncoast .
Not A Happy Guest
"Thank you for your feedback , and your comments ."
That is understandable .
"The explanation was that includes all local calls , a safe in the room , a small refrigerator and wi-fi ."
The Red Rock has all of my future business .
The Red Rock rolled out the carpet and knows how to treat people .
There is no reason for this to happen .
They could have gained my respect and lots more business from my office .
They never asked me for money or even if I was staying there at the hotel as a guest .
This finished me with the Suncoast .
Today with the economy the way it is everyone is trying to make a dollar .
We do apologize your experience was unsatisfactory .
We had dinner at the Red Rock and I decided to try and see if they would print my pass for me .
Although it was given to us free for the first night the food was lousy .
Du Pars was a much better choice .
Enjoyed our stay
Everyone was very friendly and our room was nice and clean .
"If you have any advice on how we can earn that last star , then please let us know , because our goal is to provide you with five - star service ."
My room had yellow sinks and toilet and a phone in the bathroom just like the 70's and 80's Vegas .
Thank you for your review !
The only drawback was the breakfast buffet .
We appreciate it .
Would definitelygo back .
"Also , pool area has no lifeguard or supervision of any kind , so some adults got a little unruly , drinking beer in the pool , speaking loudly etc ."
"But , overall this is a nice place to stay off the strip , especially for those traveling to Las Vegas with children ."
"I love the fact that the rooms are large , very clean and come with a small fridge ."
I think it 's great for families .
"In addition to Friday 's restaurant there are other restaurants including a 24 hour cafe and an ice cream shop that stays open late as well , very convenient ."
It is also great for families to have the shower and toilet area seperate .
"My even numbered room overlooked a roof , not so nice ."
My parents had an odd numbered room and it overlooked the pool and golf course .
"My son loves the small arcade , bowling alley , movie theatre , pool and Friday 's restaurant ."
Nice Off the Strip Hotel
"There are also shopping centers near the hotel that include just about every store and restaurant you can think of , Target , PF Changs , Mimi 's etc ."
This is really the only negative I can think of .
We have stayed at this hotel many times .
Great food and prices with impeccable service .
Great stay
Highly recommended !
Room was clean and comfortable .
Service from all employees was good .
The food choices are great .
The Italian place ( Salvatore 's I think ) was amazing .
Very easy check in .
"As for the casino , the sports book area was large and not overly busy ."
"Check - in and check - out was quick and easy and everyone was cheerful , polite , and helpful !"
Cox support got me online quickly .
Fantastic room with a view!
"I stayed here for a couple of comp 'd nights and had heard that the rooms were remodeled , so I was looking forward to it and had somewhat lofty expectations ."
I was admittedly impressed .
"If you 're looking for a golf getaway place to stay , or just someplace away from the craziness of the strip and do n't want to spend a fortune , THIS IS IT !"
It had a good - sized desk in the corner nearest the floor - to - ceiling windows and a real rolling desk chair as opposed to a more common wooden chair .
"Otherwise , it 's 5 + stars all the way !"
"The bathroom was even spacious and had two sinks , a large tub / shower , and roomy toilet area ."
"The housekeeping staff was fantastic , getting me whatever I asked for quickly ."
"The internet speed was decent , although I had to call support for connectivity assistance ."
The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is for the limited amount of table games .
"The room was larger than expected , tastefully decorated , and had a great view of the golf course next door and the mountains beyond ."
The St. Tropez Buffet was great for the price and everything was tasty and fresh !
The whole room was just great !
"There was a limited amount of table games , but the common , basic ones were all there ."
"My wife and I live in Vancouver , BC , Canada ."
"Needless to say , we love it ."
Seeking sunshine
Thank you for visiting us !
"The casino offers tons of entertainment , has bowling , several movies theatres , great restaurants and is surrounded by awesome golf courses ."
The Suncoast is located in Summerlin which is the best neighbourhood in Las Vegas .
We discovered the Suncoast several years ago and stay there frequently .
We look forward to you visiting again .
We regularly vacation in Las Vegas because of the climate .
We will absolutely be back .
Hotel was very clean plenty of stuff for the kids to do also the arcade was inexpensive and the gentleman that work there was very helpful .
I 'm not a cigarette smoker
I would Highly recommend this hotel to people visiting with kids to Las Vegas .
It 's very nice to visit Las Vegas and kind of get out of the rat race of downtown .
Nice location about 20 minutes from the strip .
Pictures are Views from our room 455 .
The only reason I did not give it an excellent is because you have to walk through the casino to get to the hotel room and you feel like you smoke a few cigarettes by the end of the Walk .
The pool area was beautiful and they also have bowling with tons of lanes and a movie theater which neither did we get to explore .
We had a wonderful stay at the Suncoast our hotel room was facing the pool and the views were absolutely perfect .
We were there to visit family and kind of busy running around .
Wonderful family hotel for Las Vegas
"Beautiful , spacious rooms massive bathrooms ."
For the price...WOW!
"Not anywhere near the strip , but if you are a hiker / climber , this a great location to access the Red Rock Canyon / Spring Mountain Recreation areas ."
Stay away from the tight slots though .
Truly a magnificent hotel .
Would go back in a heartbeat .
Comfortable an affordable
Good restaurants at the hotel and nearby .
Needed a place in the Summerlin area for a visit with relatives .
The room was clean and spacious ( we were also upgraded to a suite at the last minute ) .
"Views of the strip or mountains , or both if you get a suite ."
Well located for west Vegas activities .
Will definitely stay there again .
Great Off-Strip Hotel
"Lives up to all the previous reviews : large , quiet rooms with great view friendly staff little dated extremely smoky casino older crowd ."
We hit the Strip on a couple of evenings and did n't mind the 20 min drive back to our hotel .
We stayed for 6 nites .
I stay at Coast Casino hotels most often when in Vegas so decided to try the suncoast .
If you like Golf ... you 're right next door to Angel Park Golf club ... did n't have the time to try it out but the reviews are good .
Off the beaten path but very nice!
That said the rooms are big as are the bathrooms the staff is super friendly and the restaurants are great ...
With several shows going on everything near the strip that is reasonable was sold out .
Yes it is a bit off the beaten path but you 're back in the action in 15 minutes ...
Decent hotel .
Decent hotel. Nothing fancy. Just the basics
Even the casino area is quite small and only has basic games and machines .
If you need a clean room to just sleep in .
If you need excitement .
Just the basics .
Nothing fancy .
Then this is not the place for you .
This is the place .
"( a bargin since I probably saved 100 over the 24 hour period , by using my computer instead of gambling !! )"
49 for both nights or 59 for newer tower rooms .
"Along with Trip Advisor , and American Casino guide , our trip is just costing us mostly gambling expense ."
"Another valuable sight is Cheapo Las vegas , which will critic everything down to the buffets in Vegas ."
Hope you have as much fun as we have had !!!
"I am sitting in my room at the Suncoast as I write this reveiw to you , via high speed internet service provided by the hotel at a 9.99 fee ."
"I was surprised at any negative comments about the Suncoast , but most were positve witch steered me to give it a try ."
more for your money!!!!!
"Since it is off season and during the week , we may have not experienced the heavey smoke , bad service or disgrundled staff some have written about ."
"So to some it up , if you want to get away from the strip , want a great place to stay , want to take in a movie ( 18 screen movie theater ) , comfy beds , decent price , high speed internet , perfect size workout room , great air conditioning , good food at great prices and on and on this is the place for you !"
The buffet was wonderful .
"The rooms are huge , bathrooms gigantic , and the beds are heavenly . ( must be a coast hotel trait , Barbary coast has same beds ) We booked through trip reservations , paid 44 a night , received a coupon book upon arrival that had a free luch buffet and other offers ."
This is video poker heaven !
Trip advisor is my travelers bible .
We are going to use a coupon and stay at the Las Vegas Club downtown on fremont street when we leave here .
We are looking forward to trying the other Coast hotels because our experiences so far have been Positive .
"We checked in Monday , Sept. 26 and will depart today Sept. 28 ."
We found it right here .
"We have stayed on the strip , done all the fancy dancy hotels and wanted to try someplace the locals recommended that had all the amenities we wanted for a decent price ."
"We ordered the American Casino Guideoff the internet which was filled with valuable gambling information and 2 for one coupons for rooms and food , and gamming ."
"We used Suncoast coupons , and had a fabulous dinner buffet ( Tues Filet Mingion , Prime Rib Seafood etc ) , 2 for 1 , saved 15 . , at the Rampart nex door ."
Clean but Smelly
I found the casino to be very dreary and outdated .
"I would n't stay here again , for sure ."
The rooms were very clean and we had a nice view .
The whole place smelled of smoke and farts .
This hotel needs a better ventilation system !!
We had breakfast there and the smell of smoke permeated the restaurant so bad it was hard to eat .
Across the street are a Cheesecake Factory and a Gordon Biersch Brewpub that are both great places to eat .
"As the meeting planner , I was upgraded to a wonderful room on the 10th floor ."
Great meeting facility
I stayed her while coordinating a class in one of the hotel 's meeting rooms .
"It had a bar , living room , dining area , large separate bedroom and a huge bathroom with a jacuzzi tub and a huge shower ."
"Otherwise , I preferred to get out and eat somewhere else ."
"The Bagel Cafe Express has pretty good sandwiches , although they seemed a bit pricey ."
The bed was very comfortable .
"The Cafe Sienna served up a decent , inexpensive early bird breakfast special ."
"The meeting facility is very well run , and worth consideration if you have an event ."
"While there is a large selection of restaurants in the casino , I only patronized two :"
ac in room was very efficient and the rooms were quiet when we were therelots of eating choices in the casino and surrounding area but you do need a car in order to take advantage of this as the distances and temperatures make walking a difficult optionhowever the local bus does appear to go to the airport on a regular basis and the casino also offered a shuttle there as wellrecommended
firstly try to park at the front ( not the side ) of the hotel if you can or in the garage which has direct access to the casino the smoke from the casino floor does n't tend to filter into the lifts and upper floors unlike in some of the downtown casinos the rooms are very large and well appointed .
"great hotel, lovely rooms with great views"
those facing west have a great view of the las vegas stripwe got an early check in at noon which was good and the process was handled in a friendly but efficient way .
"Casino a bit smoky , perhaps ventilation system can be turned on higher ."
Great View of Golf Course Mountains
"Had a Comp Night at the Suncoast , 2 Queen Sized Bed room ."
"Large Bathroom , Clean Quiet ..."
"Pool area seems a little small for the average Vegas Hotel , but also offers a hot tub ."
Room seems to be larger than most vegas hotel rooms .
"Adding to the spaciousness , the bathrooms was quite also large ."
"Although the decor in the rooms were a little outdated , they were very clean and very SPACIOUS !"
Great place!
I 'd definately stay here again !
I ate at the buffet for the three days I was there .
I had two sinks in one area and then the toilet and shower in a separate part of the bathroom separated by a door .
I stayed for three days and I quite enjoyed it .
It 's quite a distance from the Strip but the mellowness and the view from my room was worth it .
"Sorry , I could not remember how much I paid exactly , but know for sure that it was way cheaper to eat there than at one of the buffets at the Strip ."
"The one thing I liked about the rooms was that it did not have the adjoining locked doors to the next room , so privacy was well in tact ."
The safe and fridge were also a plus .
"The selection of food for breakfast , lunch , and dinner was the same each day but was worth the price especially if you signed up for the casino card ."
You ca n't beat eating at a buffet for 8 + for breakfast and 11 + for dinner .
Also every one acted like it was not a big deal .
And be prepared for terrible customer service if anything does go wrong .
And for at least 8 hrs too .
At no time did we think you were scamming or something of that nature .
Beware!
But could give us no answers until she talked to the casino manager .
Casino manager did call back later in the day and did comp two nights but I find the actions of the front desk supervisor as well as the security people unacceptable !
Casino manager finally called next day and said she would comp our room for one night .
Checked the room and it appeared everything was still intact .
Customer service in the casino is outstanding in the hotel not so much .
I asked to talk to the casino manger again but was told they would not be in until noon .
I will never stay in this hotel again nor will I gamble here either .
If you stay here lock all your valuables up in the safe .
Left our room at 8 am to go to the Grand Canyon for the day .
Maybe they should have someone leave their front doors open all day and see how they feel about that !
"Please be assured that finding your room open is of great concern , and we have advised all appropriate departments of your specific situation ."
Security met us at our room .
She told us there was nothing she could do about it and she would call security .
So I guess they think it 's ok for your room to be open when you are not there !
Something is seriously wrong with the hotel in this casino !
Talk to the night supervisor at the front desk about it .
Talked to casino night supervisor about it and finally got someone who actually cared .
"Talked to us , checked the room and they decided it was no big deal as nothing was missing !"
Thank you for taking the time to post your comments .
They treated us like we were scamming them or something .
Upon returning at 9 pm that night found our hotel room door open with the lock holding the door open !
We apologize for any inconveniences you experienced during your stay .
"We hope you enjoyed the rest of your trip , the Grand Canyon must have been amazing to see in person !"
"Well to make this long story short , night was not comped ended up paying for our full 4 nights !"
"While we can understand your frustrations , please understand there are policies and procedures to be followed in a situation like this ."
EXCELLENT VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY
The casino is clean and well vented .
"The floor service is a little slow , but that is very common now a days ."
The room are very spacious and clean .
The room we clean and well maintained .
We dined at the Italian restaurant - the food was good and the service was about the same .
"We had a deluxe King size room - the room , with the pull out couch could easily sleep a family of four ."
We just stayed at the Suncoast .
"But if you frequent Las Vegas and would prefer a fabulous view of the mountains in Red Rock Canyon , no traffic and great value - then consider a stay at the Suncoast ."
"But you are still close to shopping across the street at Tivoli Gardens , which also has some nice restaurants ."
I ca n't say enough about the Suncoast !!
"If you are a first time visitor , then by all means , stay on the Strip if you want that Classic Las Vegas vibe ."
"If you want to explore Red Rock Canyon , do some hiking or horseback riding , or play golf , this would be a great place to stay ."
"My brother lives in Las Vegas , so as far as the Strip - we have been there , done that ."
Repeat Customers
"The hotel has a large casino , friendly staff and a very nice selection of upscale restaurants , midrange restaurants , even a hot dog stand in the casino near the sportsbook ."
The only downside is the distance from the Strip - which is probably a 30 minute cab ride .
The pool and hot tub are very nice and never crowded .
There is a movie theater and bowling alley .
"They also have a nightclub and on several occasions , my folks have enjoyed some great concerts at a very low ticket price ."
They saw the Lettermen and Jay and the Americans and raved about both shows .
"We ( my husband , myself and two children ) have stayed there 4 times in the past few years and my parents stay there at least three times each year when they visit ."
We have never had a bad time at Suncoast .
"You ca n't beat the low room rates , and the rooms are HUGE and very nice ."
Great Place away from Noisy strip
"I arrived at 2:00 pm for a room which I had pre-paid for and they were out of rooms so they can me an upgrade to a 10th Floor Penthouse suite at no extra cost , it was amazing and very large ."
I did n't try other restaurants .
I had come a few years later for a weekend function but stayed next door at the Marriott .
"I like the area as well , quiet and close to Red Rock Canyon ."
I stayed here mid May for a large planned Birthday Party .
Suncoast is almost as nice but far cheaper .
Sunday Brunch was OK but a good deal for 19.00 ( you get a discount at all restaurants if you get their free membership card ) .
They are building a lot of Shops and restaurants across the street .
"I stayed may and June , enjoyed it so much that we are talking about coming back next year , staff very friendly , food at the buffett very good and reasonable prices , room very clean and nice , enjoyed the pool and hot tub , parking not an issue , plenty of shopping around the hotel no complaints , highly recommend it thanks cathy and sheldon"
"loved it ,"
a walk through the casino
"If you have feedback on how we can improve , please reach out ."
"It seems that your experience was not up to our high standards , and I sincerely apologize for that !"
"Otherwise , we hope you ll visit again to give us another chance to wow you !"
"The hotel was clean and we had at our request a quiet room , room service was good ."
"We do n't gamble and really did n't care for being required to have to walk through the smoke filled casino , or even just the casino to get to our room ."
We strive for five - star experiences with every guest every time .
I experienced Pure Spa which is on site .
Our room was spacious and clean .
The beds were comfortable .
The buffet resturant was also better then expected .
They offered a great combo spa treatment which was to die for !
Unexpected pleasure!
Usually buffets are pretty boring but theirs was actually pretty good !
We had to book an extra night and it was very reasonable .
We received two free weekend nights from Suncoast .
Whenever we saw an employee they greeted us and were willing to assist !
WOW !
"A big , impressive building but understand that it is about a good 20 minute drive on expressways to get to the strip ."
"Bowling center , movie theatre , nice pool / spa area ."
"Good amenities at the Suncoast , the restaurants in the casino were all great and a good value ."
Our only reservations concerned the ( standard ) room we had .
Stayed at the Suncoast for a week in Feb. 2003 .
"Still , our overall experience was good ."
The bed had unfitted sheets and mattress pad that just slid all over the mattress and bunched up .
The carpeting looked a bit trafficked .
The first three nights whoever made the bed left the sheets a foot short at the bottom so that our feet were on the mattress pad .
Who Maid the Bed
"You will be at the extreme northwest section of the Las Vegas area making it time consuming to get to other parts of the city , but from what we saw this is probably the nicest area in greater Las Vegas ( shopping , golf courses , restaurants ) ."
"A fridge , coffee maker , flat screen TV ."
Bathroom was large and had double vanity .
It is far from most everything else .
"It is not the most fancy of rooms , but it had everything we needed ."
Located in a beautiful place near golf course .
Overall very happy and would stay again .
Plenty of places to eat in the area .
Quiet off the strip hotel
"The hotel staff was very friendly , and helpful ."
"We ate at a couple of the restaurants in the hotel and they were good , the buffet breakfast was very good variety for the money ."
"We found it quiet at night , even though we were there over a weekend , and there were families with young children staying at the hotel ."
"We found our room to be large , and clean ."
We had a nice view of the mountains and Las Vegas strip .
"We loved the location about 8 miles away from the strip , but easy drive ."
"We saw a show at the showroom , every seat is a good one ."
We spent several nights at this hotel .
"We used the pool which was very nice , not the biggest one but nicely decorated and plenty of seats ."
You do need a car if you stay at this property .
( Or perhaps consider hiring younger more friendly people ) .
"Again , I apologize that you were not able to enjoy the high quality service Suncoast has become known for but urge you to visit in the future to experience the improvements caused by your comments ."
"At some point , there was three families in line and all three of the front desk agents were looking at their computer screens completely ignoring that they had guests waiting to check in and check out for about 5 minutes ( did n't even look up once ) ."
"At Suncoast , we view all criticism as constructive and rely on it to provide better service and entertainment for our guests ."
"At the check out , a lady with white hair helped me and when I asked her for a bill she replied in a rude tone , Yeah !"
"At the restaurant , the staff was welcoming ."
But their attention to detail was missing .
Edc weekend 2017
Front desk staff is horrible .
"Hello Angy F , Thank you for your recent visit and for leaving such thorough feedback !"
I had asked for a drink with ice and they would forget the ice .
"I have to say that rooms are spacious , nice and very clean ."
I just got back from my 4 night stay here at the SunCoast hotel .
I order a plate a fruit which they completely forgot and tried to charge me for it .
It is disappointing to learn that we were unsuccessful in meeting these high standards during your time with us and I am sorry that it caused you to have less than a five star visit .
Might not sound like a bad response but it 's the way the person says it that has a bad effect .
"On the other hand , costumer service is very bad ."
One afternoon I tried to order room service at around 2:40 and to my surprise the lady on the phone advised me that there was n't anyone to take my order at the moment .
Our team members strive to be friendly and personable during every interaction and are taught that service should always be prompt and accurate .
So If i wanted to eat I had to go downstairs to the restaurant .
Thankfully I remember and got the charge voided .
That 's what I 'm doing .
They seated us quickly .
Valet staff was also nice and was understanding when I forgot a couple items and the gentlemen who helped us carry our bags was very kind and welcoming as well .
When I first arrived I immediately thought this was a beautiful hotel .
"Which it is , but I do believe the staff needs to have some costumer service orientations ."
"breakfast buffets , have to be used the following day ."
I explained that we were not told it could only be used for that particular date as our stay was for more that one day .
Last year for annual Suncoast stay
My only negative comment is how unwilling they are to satisfy a customer issue .
NO credit .
Other casinos vouchers are good for a longer period of time .
Plenty of places to choose from when visiting Las Vegas .
Pretty sure 15.00 is n't going to break them and I do n't like feeling cheated .
Someone had visited a bar and charged it to our room .
Suncoast is n't the only game in town !
"Sunrise breakfast for 3.99 in the caf , but you have to know about it as it is not on the menu ."
The food is average .
The front desk gal said she 'd look into it and within an hour was corrected .
The pool never seems crowded .
The rooms are very spacious and we have never had a problem with noise .
The rooms have recently been renovated with an updated dcor .
This will definitely be a deciding factor for our next trip .
Tried to use buffet coupons one day after expiration .
Very poor customer service considering the size of Boyd properties .
"We are members of their BConnected players program and do receive the occasional perk , however be aware that anything you win ie ."
We had a 15.00 food credit on the room which apparently was only good for that particular date ( we used it the day before ) and upon check - out was charged to the room .
"We had an issue with our bill at check - out , as we do every year ."
"We like the location , off the strip in more of the residential area ."
We stay at this property at least once a year when we head to Vegas to visit family .
We were told to go to the players club and see about getting comps ... were told NO .
"Years ago I used to win money or break even , not so for the past few years ."
Horrible
I hate it very disappointed .
It is a dump I would n't suggest this place to my worst enemy !!
Consider a better hotel
Try to avoid unless you absolutely have to .
"Could have been worse, just ok"
"I must say the bathroom was in great shape , there was no mold or mildew in the tub and it appeared that the room and bathroom had a fresh coat of paint and the tub was new ."
It served the purpose
"It was ok , since we were there to attend a concert and shop at outlet , so the room served the purpose ."
"The room was decent as far as cleanliness , however , the room was very small with two beds and there was no closet or rack to hang up your clothing ."
"A group of friends and I ( girls , early 20s ) stayed here on Saturday 12 / 28 and our total room cost was 115 ."
"And no , we did n't see any hookers !"
Anything beats paying 700 a night at Revel ( that was their rate on the same night !!! ) .
Beds were actually pretty comfortable !
But we were pleasantly surprised !
Check in and check out went very quickly and smoothly .
Did n't use the TV .
Great experience!
I was VERY nervous about choosing this hotel because of the negative reviews .
I would n't recommend this place to a couple only because it 's not really romantic or anything .
"It 's very basic , which is what we were looking for ."
"Not the friendliest people , but they got the job done ."
"Outdated , but clean ."
Parking is 10 which is annoying but you have to pay to park ANYWHERE in Atlantic City so I did n't mind .
The bathrooms were also very clean .
The rooms were very clean !
"The shower 's water pressure was n't the best , but we dealt with it ."
"There is a free breakfast but of course we did n't wake up early enough ( ends at 10 ) , however there was still fresh , hot coffee at 12 pm when we checked out which was nice ."
"This place is definitely NOT a 5 - star hotel , but it 's also not bad either ."
We chose Rodeway because it was only a mile away from Bader Field where Life in Color was .
We found a place to park right outside of our room which was great .
"We were barely in our room all night , so this hotel is perfect for a group of friends who are just looking for a place to shower , pregame , and sleep ."
bad customer service
Te service no good .
They need training customer service .
This was worst hotel .
"Again , Please DO NOT STAY HERE"
BE CAREFUL DO NOT STAY HERE
Fortunately there was a table to leave my bag on .
"I stood there in amazement while the pimp told them exactly what was expected of them that nigh , ."
I was afraid to put my bag on the carpet .
"In my bathroom window there was edible RAT poison in the open , not to mention the 1 inch Gap under the front door ."
Literally .
The clincher was on our way out to dinner a maroon cadilac pulls up a 4 of the most disgusting prostitutes get out ready to ply there trade .
"The room smelled terrible , I 've seen thicker paper towels the the rags in the bathroom ."
"Toilets , mattress ' , TV 's , bottles , condom wrappers were everywhere ."
Upon arrival the parking lot looked like a dump yard .
What a filthy rat trap hotel .
Where to begin !!!
Breakfast was just coffee and one muffin ....
Everything is small here I suggest to stay at a casino hotel next time .
"It was worth 60 a night with tax on a Friday , Very minimum small room ."
Looks renovated but the bathroom needs a lot of work !
No wifi even though the front desk gave me a password it do n't even work !
Stayed for one night on a business trip .
Summer is probably a little better .
The area is pretty sketchy not the best around !!!
You get what you pay for
Cubs retreat!
For us it was a fabulous location getting on rail to Cubs game and shopping for what we wanted to do .
"It 's was easily accessible for dining as well Everyone in the hotel was very kind and were able to help with any questions we had Hello Pam D , We are glad our location made your visit to Chicago ideal for your Cubs game !"
Our service level is something we pride ourselves on and glad it showed during your trip .
We hope to see you next time in town !
I took the train from O'Hare and it was super easy !
I would most definately stay there again on my next trip to Chicago -
My room was a basic Club Quarters room - standard amenities .
Perfect Location !!
The public transportation / train system is excellent and the hotel is a short 5 - 10 minute walk to many of the lines .
The staff was very friendly and helpful .
This hotel is in a perfect location to downtown Chicago - could n't ask for better !
Across the street is a running / walking path along the river .
Great for people watching .
It 's a 50 cab ride from the airport .
Nice neighborhood
Plenty of shopping and dining in the area .
The hotel is right across the river from the Trump Hotel .
There is a Irish Pub just around the corner from the hotel .
Watched a Cubs game while there .
Would stay here again .
Wrigley field was n't too far away by taxi .
I could not get to sleep my second night there because I heard doors shut the entire night .
I stayed at the hotel three nights .
I was on the 25th floor .
I was very disappointed by the level of noise at night .
I will never stay at a Club Quarters hotel again .
"In addition to the noise , the hotel somehow lost my reservation in their system and I had to escalate the issue all the way up to management to get it resolved ."
It was n't easy .
Noisy hotel
The doors were EXTREMLY loud .
I 'm paying maybe 170 / night before taxes and fees .
It 's very modern and a bit on the side of a luxurious room .
Nice room
"The room is relatively small , but I would say this is norm for downtown Chicago ."
the room is very nice .
there 's a Keurig Coffee machine .
"And the lobby , while not grand , is also appealing ."
"But in retrospect , I should have paid an extra 30 to stay at a place that felt more upbeat ."
C-minus .
Extremely basic
"I had a small room , which was fine , but it was just very bland ."
"It is nt terrible , but there just is not one thing about it that makes it the least bit special ."
"My only plusses were : it s location , the fact that I was able to check in early , and free internet ."
"My rate was 200 , which was less than other properties the weekend I stayed ."
"Once I got into my room , though ho hum ."
"The bed covering is one of those bad synthetic things , there were only two limp pillows on the bed stuff like that ."
"The building , built way back when , is charming from the outside ."
The place just felt very cheap and kind of sad .
"The place looked promising from the approach its right on the river , facing the beautiful River North area ."
There was nt even an iron or board in the room .
"Those are nt strong enough factors , though next time I m in Chicago , I ll stay somewhere else ."
"Alex F , for choosing the River Hotel and for taking the time to post a review ."
Amazing hotel
I would defiantly go back there and highly recommend it .
It is right by the river which is a nice view .
"Thank you ,"
The hotel is one of the best hotels I have stayed in .
The location is great and you can easily walk to all the main attractions .
The room was really modern and clean .
The staff were really friendly and helpful .
There was a coffee machine in the room and the hotel provided complementary fruits and soda and water .
"We are thrilled to know you enjoyed the accommodations , prime location and friendly staff ."
We sincerely appreciate your high recommendation and we look forward to seeing you on your next visit !
"A king , a queen , a sitting area with pull out couch made everyone comfortable ."
Complimentary purified chilled water near the elevator was a nice touch .
"Kind regards ,"
Kitchenette was convenient to make an instant oatmeal for the next morning .
"Staying over night with a few ladies ( co - workers , friends ) while attending a multi-day convention ."
"Thank you , Chris9767 for choosing the River Hotel ."
This room was perfect for our needs .
Two bathroom kitchenette suite
Two bathrooms allowed everyone a little more time to get ready for the next day .
Very comfortable beds .
We appreciate you taking the time to post a review and look forward to welcoming you back soon .
We are delighted to hear you found the accommodations and hotel amenities to your liking .
After a long flight we asked for a quiet room that had a great view when we woke up .
Dilemma Value/Location Vs Lack of Sleep
Given we would be out and about most days we just wanted something decent we could get a good sleep in and was clean .
Impossible to sleep with it on even with the supplied ear plugs .
It 's not the city noise that 's the problem it 's these two things .
It certainly lived up to our expectations .
It was by far the best value for money I could find with most other hotels almost double .
Maybe a different room would make a difference to this review overall of the hotel .
River Hotel check in was quick and easy .
So overall looking back on this trip I think the value and location win out ever so slightly .
The air con in the room was the only thing noisier !
We chose this hotel based on the price and location .
We got a room with a view of the alley way and some kind of air con vents outside ( 1011 ) .
We loved the free filtered water and bottles .
Whatever the air con thing was outside had a constant hum and it would drive anyone crazy .
Computers with internet access a plus .
Easy to access by public transportation .
Excellent location
Friendly staff .
Perfect hotel for a single female traveller .
"The hotel was clean , convenient , and steps away from major attractions ."
"The only gripe I had was the elevators ... there are only two of them , so visitors can wait a while for them to arrive ."
"The room is smaller than average , but not too small , and the perfect size for a traveller who is not planning on spending much time in the hotel room anyway ."
I 've stayed in so many Chicago hotels I lost count .
"If these things are disturbing to you , do n't stay here ."
"If you crave peace and quiet , four star ambiance and price , you should go up to the Peninsula ."
If you want to save money stay here!
Parking was only 36 per 24 hours here .
"Recalling that you are in a big city here and not some country estate , would night noise from the Loop be a surprise Would a panhandler on the sidewalk be a shock Of course not ."
"Room very modern , large and included a fridge and pull out comfy chair ."
The front desk staff was very helpful and hip .
"The Italian restaurant in the building is very charming and did I mention the building is an architectural masterpiece by Herbert Hugh Riddle , 1928 It s a gem ."
This location is excellent .
And it is this indecisiveness which makes or breaks this hotel .
"As being a guest in Chicago , you can afford the luxury of spending a couple of hours on the architectural tour through downtown Chicago ."
"Chile , Thank you for providing us with feedback on your stay ."
"Due to the height , rooms tend to be windy even with closed windows ."
Either do the modern streak or go completely back into the history of 1920's .
Hello LowieSantiago
"It must have had the same strange feeling , you now get from the Trump tower ."
My advice would be stay low .
Nostalgia in modern Chicago
"Situated opposite the Trump tower , you get a feeling of the grandeur of the 1920s , when the hotel was build ."
The first building they tell you about is the River hotel .
"The new offering a business floor , the tiny modernized reception room , the good quality Wi - Fi and free water they serve ."
"The old is the buildings shape and elevators , the various signs and sometimes not well maintained emergency staircases ."
"The room was ok , but why this old fashioned ugly bathroom"
The view from the window was amazing but the cold wind chilled up the room sometimes to an uncomfortable temperature .
To be fair the prices are reasonable for downtown Chicago but the hotel just misses the finesses to make it to a four star .
"Ugly , grotesque , aiming at the very rich and symbolizing something which does not exist and proves to be a dream ."
We are continually working to enhance the guest experience and will use your comments to do so .
We hope to see you back next time you come to town .
"We were staying on a high floor and really getting in the top of the building , you are offered small floors with smaller rooms ."
"While we now call the building historical nostalgia with it s weird toptower as of floor 24 , the hotel offers a mixture of the old and the new ."
"Why do they forget a bedside table and when asked for and promised , the thing , it never showed up"
Why have a decent desk but not enough electricity points
I definitely recommend it .
"It was really nice to have snacks , sodas , coffee and water at all times ."
Please come see us again !
Really nice for very little
Thank you for choosing the River Hotel and for your recommendation .
The employees were very nice .
The price was really good realeated to the services .
The room was nice although a little bit small .
"A guest lounge on the second floor offers a large lobby , TV , computer terminals and an array of snacks , fruit , beverages ."
Dear Jeri
"G , thank you for taking the time to write a review and especially the kind words you had for Roman , Diego and the staff ."
Perfect first time visit to Chicago
The highest praise is reserved for the front desk staff - Ramon and Diego were friendly and competent making restaurant suggestions that were delicious ( Benny 's Chop House ) .
The rooms are comfortable with basic amenities and free wi - fi but best suited for one person .
There is nothing we love more than being able to share wonderful comments like yours with the staff and we will be sure the team sees it .
"This unassuming hotel is well located for sightseeing , restaurants and views of the Chicago River and the river walk ."
We are so glad you choose The River Hotel for your first visit to Chicago as our prime location makes an ideal base for experiencing all the city has to offer .
We look forward to welcoming you back soon !
I ca n't say enough good things about this hotel .
It was refreshing to have the help when you are travelling .
Roman was also very helpful .
The concierge desk was fantastic !
"The room was small , but the dcor and the view made up for it ."
"The staff was very friendly , not a single person passed us without saying hello and asking us how we were ."
"This was our second trip to Chicago , but our first at The River Hotel ."
"Tim was amazing , his recommendations were spot on , he helped us with directions , whether it was taking the train , a bus or walking ."
We will definitely be staying here again .
weekend getaway
Awesome hotel location.
It was a little small but all Chicago rooms are small .
It was clean and had a great view of the river and the Trump building across the river .
The bed was comfortable .
The location was close to all the downtown attractions with a big bus double decker bu stop right across the street .
The room was great .
The staff at the front desk was amazing .
They also provided some great recommendations for breakfast .
They provided us with coupons for a free appetizer or dessert at Lou Malnatis .
We stayed the weekend at the River Hotel and could not have been happier .
All in all a great expericen for the price .
As well when checking in we had reserved 3 rooms and they were showing a record of only 2 rooms .
Bella Bacino restuarant is located within the hotel and we had a fabulous Chicago style deep dish pizza there .
Fantastic Location!
If you cross the Magnificent mile you have gone too far .
It s located right by the Chicago river 1 block from the Magnificent Mile .
It s well hidden .
It was a bit of a pain but nothing terrible .
Maid staff was fantastic and left extra towels as requested .
My only concern with the hotel was its hard to see when driving down Wacker drive .
Once we were given our rooms we were told we had 3 rooms with a queen size bed and a sleeper chair .
Overall I was quite pleased with the River Hotel .
The bathroom was a decent size and the room had everything I could have wanted .
The location alone makes this hotel worth it .
The rooms were smaller then normal but there were nt uncomfortably small .
There is even a Double Decker trolly stop right near the hotel .
They did have a secured area on the 3rd floor to store luggage after checking out so that we could still tour the city .
They did work towards figuring things out but it did take some time .
Unfortunatly 2 of the rooms did nt have sleeper chairs so we had to go back to the front desk and be relocated again .
A coffee pot in the main room ....
A greeting giving us details about Sunday and late checkout .
A greeting welcoming us on the voice mail system .
A refrigerator and microwave .
Available Ipads for guest use .
Comfortable chair that folds out into single bed .
Give this hotel a try !
I am glad I changed this time and booked The River Hotel in Chicago .
I have visited Chicago often in the past and always have booked a different hotel .
I must also add that this is a green Hotel with lots of Green features built in .
I was pleasantly greeted by a clean crisp modern room that offered plenty of space .
Luxury comforter .
Not in the bathroom .
Purified water provided at each floor .
Security system that only allows guests of that floor to enter that floor .
Some of the details of our stay included :
The staff was friendly on checkout and there were no extra charges .
The toiletries / shampoo / lotion is high quality .
This hotel provides a great room at a good price .
Try River Hotel!!! You'll be glad you did!!
It was all really just ' good enough . '
It was the location that mattered most in the end .
It was very easy to walk to almost all of our sight seeing destinations .
Our room smelled faintly of smoke
Previous reviews generally correct
QuietFriendly staff
Tasty restaurant downstairs
"The Cons : The bed / bedding not horrible , but I just could n't get a good night 's sleep"
The elevator took forever
The Pros : Location ( is really excellent )
Traditionally we prefer hotels that have more comfort and amenities .
We chose this hotel based on location and cost .
Beautiful art - deco building on the river with big rooms and a marvelous view at the rivers and skyscrapers - should ask at arrival room with view .
good hotel in excellent location
Additionally we have thoroughly trained all of our housekeeping associates to inspect our guest rooms for any signs of pest activity .
Anna HampsonHotel Manager - River Hotel
BED BUGS
"Front desk for your efforts to accommodate , but we could not deal with the bed bugs in your hotel ."
Guest feedback is important to us and we take any comment regarding bedbugs seriously .
I encourage anyone with questions or comments regarding our pest control policy to contact me directly at 312.777.0805 .
"If necessary , our pest control company conducts bed bug elimination procedures using the latest in pesticide technology ."
Respectfully
"So this hotel is pretty nice to look at , and the staff was very friendly , however , we entered the room ( very small ) and continued to look at the room ."
Thank you
"We continued and the front desk and they upgraded our room , however due to our disgust we arranged a booking at the Hyatt Regency down the road which was beyond clean ."
We have a proactive pest elimination policy that includes regularly scheduled inspections by a professional pest control company .
"We lifted up the sheets and it was clean and mattress was clean , however in the box spring of the bed , there was a swarm of bed bugs that once we flashed the light on them they all dove into the box spring ."
2 ) The elevator was unreliable .
4 ) The staff have no concept of customer service .
"After checking in , myself and another guest were stuck on the first floor because of a malfunctioning card - reader in the elevator ."
"At checkout , no one has ever asked me whether I enjoyed my stay ."
But expect to be treated like a third - class citizen if you stay here .
"I had reserved a room with a queen size bed through Expedia , but was given a room with two twin beds instead ."
I recently stayed at the Club Quarters while in Chicago for a family gathering .
Not a good sign . 3 ) The room reminded me of a depressing college dorm room .
"On a prior visit , the staff were not willing to make any accomodations for a late checkout ( even 15 minutes after the official checkout time - truly Kafkaesque ) ."
"Overall , the location is great , the rooms are clean and quiet , and all of the appliances work ."
Stay here if you don't mind crappy service
The excuse : they ran out of bedspreads for queen size beds ( how lame is that ) .
The front desk staffperson fortunately was able to jiggle her card in a way that prompted the elevator to start moving .
This hotel was a major disappointment for several reasons : 1 ) They do n't honor their commitments .
"Based on that , I recommend it ."
But the pillows are fluffy .
"Dear Ann C , Thank you for your recommendation !"
Good enough
"I will say , however , that the bed is on the hard side and not the most comfortable ."
It 's also affordable .
"Not the typical hotel bed where you feel like you 're sleeping on clouds , but it does the trick , I suppose ."
"Still , all in all , the staff is friendly and the location is really convenient if you 'll be spending time downtown ."
The room is quiet and the wifi is free .
"The room is small , but comfortable ."
The sheets have a papery feel to them as well .
We look forward to welcoming you back in the future .
We sincerely appreciate you taking the time to provide feedback about your recent experience .
We stayed in a small queen room for 2 nights .
Excellent and good value for money
"I would highly recommend it for business and leisure stay as it is centrally located , proximity to shopping malls , restaurants and the Millennium Park ."
Stayed with my family here and we loved its location and friendly customer services especially from the front desk ( Pedro ) and cleaning services .
"Great location, small but comfy rooms"
"Our room was small , but perfectly adequate since we were n't in Chicago to spend time in our hotel room ."
The couple at the table next to us were staying at the Fairmont and their concierge recommended it .
"The hotel reminded me of a European hotel , especially since it 's in an old building ."
"The hotel restaurant is surprisingly good , and makes the famous Chicago deep dish pizza ."
"The location is perfect right across the street from the River , near Michigan Ave. between the Magnificent Mile and the Loop ."
"This hotel is a Club Quarters hotel , which means that it is geared towards business travelers ."
"C , We are happy to hear our location suited you well during your trip ."
Having the water bottle filling stations was a great benefit .
Hello Kathleen
I had a great view of the river from the room !
River Hotel Review
The location is amazing ... right on the river and within walking distance to tons of shops and restaurants .
The self checkout was a breeze !
The staff were all friendly and helpful .
We are lucky to be located right in middle of the city close to everything .
We look forward to seeing you next time in town .
We pride ourselves on service and happy to hear we met our goal during your stay .
Because of this insensitivity I 've had to lower the rating of the hotel .
"How often have you stayed at a hotel and asked for a late checkout Has any hotel wanted to charge you for it Well , this hotel charges 35 for late checkout !"
"Nice Clean Hotel, Great Location, but Rigid Policies"
"Rooms are nice , sleek and clean but SMALL ."
The hotel would make no exception or allowance .
"This hotel is located across the river from the Trump Hotel which makes it walkable to Michigan Ave , Millenium Park and possibly even Navy Pier ."
We 'd prefer to have eaten and then packed up .
We ended up having to go the hospital emergency room and did n't return to our room until 3:00 am .
"We had a situation , where my mom , a senior , was traveling with me and was injured the nite of our stay at an outing ."
We had to hurry and pack .
"When we woke at 11:00 am , we were hoping they 'd allow us a late check out so we 'd have time to get some food , especially since she is diabetic ."
Amazing Hotel
Best price hotel in the city !
Classy place .
"Great location , walking distances to everything !"
"If you needed something , they were on it !"
"Our room was very modern , clean , and beds were comfortable ."
Staff was professional and friendly .
Very quiet for when you are ready to rest !
"Fantastic location but for 200 / night , I would have expected a larger room ."
"My room was smaller than any hotel I 've stayed at in NY , London or Hong Kong where rooms are notoriously small ."
"Overpriced, teeny, tiny rooms"
"There are many , many better options near the Mag Mile and in River North so look elsewhere ."
Great Spring Break 2018!!!
I would do this again in a heart beat with my family or friends .
research your plans before anything you do .
Thanks for the help trip advisor also other websites .
"The staff , room , experience in Chicago for being the first time was great ."
Great Stay!
I really enjoyed my stay at The River Hotel !
I will definitely be recommending this hotel to any friends traveling to Chicago !
It had a great location .
It was nice to grab a bottle and fill it up before heading out for the day .
One of my favorite features of the hotel was the free bottles of water .
Our room overlooked the Chicago River and we were directly across from Trump Tower .
"The hotel was also within walking distance to almost everything we wanted to do ( Millenium Park , Shedd aquarium , the Field Museum , Magnificent Mile , food , etc . ) ."
Very cool .
"Also , the staff was friendly and the customer service manager that assisted us , Pedro , was very helpful ."
"Dear 216 jvs , Thank you for your detailed review of the River Hotel ."
Gir's weekend
"My sister and I stayed in a room with a wonderful view of Trump Tower , Marina City , the Chicago 's river and bridges ."
Our room had twin beds that were firm but comfortable to sleep on .
Pedro is a great asset to our operation and I will make sure he sees your kind words .
Stayed overnight on 4/23/16 with my sister at the hotel and was very pleasantly surprised !
The hotel 's location was great and the interiors were very stylish .
The hotel was perfect for our needs !
"The room itself , although small , was clean and nicely decorated ."
We look forward to welcoming you back in the fall !
We plan on coming again in the fall for another weekend downtown and will be staying there again .
We wanted a place to stay near the loop where we could make the most of our weekend downtown .
Comfortable and clean rooms with a friendly staff .
"Excellent hotel, excellent location!"
"Hello nchat1 ,"
I would stay there again without hesitation .
Thank you for the kind words regarding your experience .
The amenities included complimentary bottled water near the elevators and snacks in the 2nd floor business center .
The hotel 's location is excellent and right on the river .
The hotel was very quiet - I heard very little noise from other guests .
We look forward to having you back with us next time you come to Chicago !
We work hard to ensure our guests are happy and it clearly paid off !
Another wonderful stay
Thank you for staying with us recently and for your kind recommendation both are greatly appreciated !
The location is perfect for walking to many touristy spots .
We agree -- our prime location in the heart of the city is perfect for experiencing all that Chicago has to offer .
We are pleased to hear that you are a great fan of the River Hotel and delighted that your granddaughter had a wonderful stay .
We brought our 6 year old granddaughter to Chicago with us .
We even walked to and from union station .
We have stayed at this hotel at least 6 times and have never been disappointed .
We look forward to welcome you back to the River Hotel very soon !
Did we just get lucky
I do n't know if we just got lucky and got the biggest room they had for that price or if they 're all like that .
It 's a very simple lobby with just a couple of people in the reception and you could check in via a touch screen .
It 's right in the middle of downtown Chicago and within walking distance to pretty much everything .
It had two TVs and two bathrooms .
It was a great surprise for us and our kid could even play hide and seek with us !
It was n't too cheap compared to normal hotels but all the other hotels close by were a lot more expensive so it felt like a good deal .
There 's plenty of restaurants and shops everywhere close by anyway .
There was a restaurant right next by but we did n't try it .
"We had a couple of days to spend in Chicago and wanted a hotel close to our car rental and to a train station , this place fit the bill ."
"We ordered a room with two beds because of our kid and was expecting two beds close together , but we got a huge room which was pretty much two rooms in one with a hallway in between ."
Spectacular view and wonderful Service :)
"Thank You to the staff , we will definetly return to see them again the next time we are in town ."
The stay here really helped make our trip to Chicago amazing and very enjoyable .
"Tim and Devon were more than willing to help us with any questions we had about getting around the city , which was a very nice gesture you do n't see often ."
Tim took care of us at the desk and set us up with a spacious room with a spectacular view .
Upon arriving to our hotel we were greeted warmly by a friendly door man then proceed to check in where a friendly and helpful gentlemen named
"1 . The a /c , even when set to 65 , was warmish , and only blowed in the entryway , not in the bed area . 2 ."
"6 . That entryway was dark , even with it s one light turned on . 7 ."
All these things could be tweaked and it would be a good place .
But if I peeled that away there was just the sheet .
But more things wrong than I 've ever encountered in 1 hotel room :
Get rid of coffee dispensed in those plastic cup thingies - so bad for the environment !
"I lost count after that , but you get the idea ."
I was ecstatic at first .
"If you turned that off , the bed light went off too . 3 ."
No ironing board ! 4 .
"Nothing to put the soap on , just the bathroom counter ."
Some things right... so many things wrong
That 's icky .5 .
"The bedspread was cool looking , but not something I 'd like to sit on or sleep under ."
The building looks beautiful the lobby too .
"The counter with the coffee machine was dark too , even with the light turned on . 8 ."
"The light next to the bed was linked to the entry light : if you wanted the bed light to work , you had to have that hall light on ."
"They upgraded me to a room with 2 bedrooms , 3 tvs and 2 baths !"
"Great Location, Tiny Rooms"
It seems standard these days that 1 - bed rooms will be outfitted with a King bed and 2 - bed rooms with 2 Queens or at least Doubles .
Our room had a Queen bed which took up most of the room and my mom and brother 's room had 2 Twins !
"The location was great and the staff was very helpful and friendly , but our room and bathroom / shower were very small and the bed was hard as a rock ."
The TV was extremely tiny compared to any other hotel I 've stayed at and my 6 ' 2 husband had a hard time taking in shower in the tiny space .
We were given rooms at this hotel on Hotwire .
Would n't stay here again due to the uncomfortable room .
", walk in Lincoln Park and a very pleasant restaurant for dinner with live jazz ."
Great Stay! Thanks Virginia!
I enjoyed my stay tremendously .
"I was initially disappointed with the size / layout of my room , so we nt right back to the front desk to complain ( rooms are small but clean and staff is helpful ) ."
"Next day Virginia suggested a trip to the Art Institute , only a 10 minute walk from the hotel !"
"She inquired about my interests and 10 minutes later I had tickets for Wicked , one of the hottest shows in town , dinner reservations at Vivo , trendy Italian restaurant in the theater district ."
Since it was my first visit to Chicago I asked Virginia about things to do in the area .
Stayed at Club Quarters Downtown in April .
"Virginia , the gal at the desk apologized and instantly moved me to a room with a view of Chicago River ."
What a great city !
"Will be back , thanks again Virginia !"
I would definitely stay here on my next visit .
Just perfect
"Loved this hotel for its service , amenities , location ( walking distance to everything ) , free wine hour , laundry room , the rooms were very clean , perfect size , comfortable bed ."
"It is across from the Trump Towers and the river where you can get on a boat and go for a little cruise , the Big Bus company stops directly across the street from the hotel"
The rooms are small but well thought out .
They are very cosy and comfortable .
Wonderful
I do n't spend much time in a hotel room so the lack of space was not a problem .
"I would stay here again as the location is wonderful , the price is reasonable and room adequate ."
small clean room
The room was small quite clean the staff very helpful .
a medium is a large ... etc .
Absolutely perfect for my needs
But suffice it to say that I was IMPRESSED .
Dear John
"Even the conference was well prepped and attended by the hotel staff with fresh coffee , tea , and complimentary sodas that were refreshed at every break ."
"For now , suffice it to say the food was DELICIOUS , the service was also 5 star , and the price - while not as inexpensive as I am accustomed to - was as affordable ( more so ) than comparable places nearby ."
"However , the break in price was compensation for this and ( since I was only needing work space sleep ) I did not NEED more ."
I could continue ...
I received free bottled water from a water station in the hallway .
"I received friendly , efficient 5 star service for a 3 star price - from every single employee shift - both day night ."
"I took the elevator down , crossed the lobby , took another elevator up to the conference ( the two elevators - activated only by your room key card - ensured that the guest rooms were secure from being accessed by non guests ) ."
"I was attending a conference at the River Hotel ( January 30 - 31 , 2016 ) ."
I will review it separately .
Just be aware that a small is a medium ...
"My 17th floor small room , overlooked the river , the Trump Tower , the River Walk , and the city lights and sounds only added to the ambiance ."
My room was small .
No extras .
NOTE : The hotel has an on site Italian Restaurant called Bella Bacinos .
Period .
"S ,"
Thank you for choosing the River Hotel and for your detailed review of your experience .
"That said , if I am ever in Chicago again - for work or vacation - I WILL be back ."
The River Hotel found me a small room for a VERY reasonable ( unbelievable ) rate .
The staff was EXCELLENT .
The vending machines were reasonable .
There is nothing I like more than sharing great comments with the team and I will certainly pass along your kind words .
"There was one queen sized bed , a desk , a pull out work station , and a full ( shower ) bath ."
This one was small .
"This was purely business so I wanted to minimize my stress by staying at ( or near ) the conference location by being able to fly in , then shuttle to from O'Hare airport and yet have plenty of dining options within walking distance of the hotel ."
We are beyond thrilled to know we are your hotel of choice when visiting Chicago .
We are so proud of our staff services as well as our prime location and are delighted you were pleased as well .
We will look forward to welcoming you back soon !
"Yes , I have read the reviews about the small rooms ."
YES .
"Yet it met MY needs ( listed above ) and my usual criteria of CLEAN , COMFORTABLE , and SAFE ."
"- Matrresses are firm ... not so firm those of us who prefer softer beds can not sleep , but firm . -"
"Close to shopping , parks , restaurants , Navy Pier and most downtown sights . -"
"Complimentary ater bottles and purified water on all floors . - Lounge with complimentary snacks , coffee , tea , and soda open for much of the day . -"
"If you are going to Chicago to shop , sight see , or hit a few wonderful restaurants and want a clean , well maintained hotel where you can sleep peacefully - this is your place ."
In and out valet parking for a reasonable Chicago price ( 52 / day ) .
It did take 20 minutes to get our car when requested . -
Nice Place To Lay Your Head for the pricr
"Responsive , kind staff . - Free high speed internet is high speed enough for most purposes ."
So if you are going to Chicago to stay in your luxury hotel to be pampered with massages and 5 star room service - this is not your hotel .
The cable is not top quality and goes out or the stream gets paused often .
The less fabulous aspects :- Rooms are small or sparsely decorated .
The perks : - Great location !
The price is great for what you get .
"The rooms serve as a clean , functional space ."
"There are few frills , but the accommodations are very reasonable in terms of function and comfort ."
"There are no bathtubs , only showers ."
Valet was understaffed for our visit with only one attendant even during busier times .
Wine in the Lobby in the evening . -
"You can find cheaper parking nearby , but not with in and out options . -"
"You get a a couch , TV , mini fridge and desk if you upgrade to a queen suite ."
"Dear azelinaf2017 , Thank you for giving us a perfect rating and for recommending our hotel to other travelers ."
Great value for money .
I 'm sure our entire hotel staff enjoyed catering to your needs as much as you enjoyed your stay .
I thoroughly recommend the hotel to anyone visiting Chicago .
"I was particularly impressed with Pedro on the front desk , who was cheerful and obliging , and a great ambassador for the hotel ."
Pedro is great and a big part of our team and I will be sure he sees your kind words .
Please come see us again !
Thank you for taking the time to recognize him as you have .
The best thing about The River Hotel is the staff !
"The location is perfect , and the rooms both comfortable and private ."
They make you feel extremely welcome and that they can not do enough to accommodate you .
Wonderful hotel!
Contemporary rooms in a great old building .
"Friendly staff , wonderful Italian restaurant right next door ."
Great Hotel in a perfect location
My new favorite hotel in Chicago !
Within short walking distance to so many great Chicago attractions .
"A few little things to be improved to me are the waiting time ( up or down ) at the elevator - one elevator only for the upper floors - Insulation in the room ( Air , street noise ) could be better too ."
But overall a good experience .
"Great location ( downtown , access to bus and Metro , shops , restaurants ) ,"
"Great location, good hotel"
"Very good and friendly service , general comfort , I did benefit from a special price offer due to low attendance i guess ."
After about 15 minutes the issue was resolved and we got our car back .
After reading all the bad reports on his hotel we were debating on switching to a different hotel .
"He ran down at least a block and flagged down a cab , he got in the cab with the driver and came back to the hotel so we could get our cab ."
He was very helpful in getting us a cab .
I m glad we stayed here .
I would recommend it to anyone looking for a resonable priced hotel near Michigan Ave.
If you 're looking for a high end hotel this is not the hotel for you
It s a very nice hotel in a great location .
It was a very nice thing to do considering the day we were there it was sleeting and raining and everyone in chicago was trying to get a cab at the same time .
MAKE SURE YOU GET A TICKET !!!
My husband did not get a ticket at the parking garage and when he inquired about it at the office in the parking garage the girl told him not to worry about it .
nice hotel for a great price
The entire staff was very helpful including the doorman .
"We never waited for an elevator , the rooms were clean , the location was great ."
We opted for the 20.00 option .
We stayed at Club Quarters in December .
We were in town for the weekend to see Wicked .
We were one block off of Michigan Ave and about 5 blocks from the theater district .
We were told we could valet park for 36.00 or for 20.00 we could park for a 24 hour time limit in a parking garage right down the street .
Well on Sunday morning when he tried to get our car back it was an issue .
When we arrived at 1230 pm we were able to check in .
Yes the rooms are small but how long are you really in your room The rooms were clean and that s really most important .
You have to have a ticket to be able to get your car back .
"Anyway , after my experience , absolutly , I would suggest this hotel for a pleasant and comfortable stay in chicago ."
"D , Thank you for choosing the River Hotel and for taking the time to provide a detailed review of your experience ."
Dear Concetta
"Every day at 5.00 pm , in the lobby is arranged a complementary wine free for the hotel hosts ."
I was in chicago for a business travel so i ca n't give you informations about costs because i did n't manage the booking of the hotel .
"In each floor , near the lift , you can find a free water dispenser with new bottles and also some chocolates and candys ."
It is located in the loop ( the city center ) on the river in front of the Trump tower .
It is really close to millenium park and magnificent mile ( two of the most touristics place in the city ) .
Moreover the hotel is close ( 5 - 7 minutes by walk ) to the underground line for the O'Hare airport .
My experience in this hotel was perfect !
Perfect!
"Rooms are clean , well - appointed , not so big but privided of all comforts ( Tv , coffee machine , bathroom , and free wifi ) ."
The hotel is very well mainteined and clean but the strenght point is the position in the city .
The staff of the hotel is extremly avaible and ready to meet all you needs .
We are thrilled to know you found everything to your liking .
We really enjoy passing on comments such as yours to our colleagues and thanking them for their great guest service .
We sincerely appreciate your recommendation !
"Great hotel nothing spectacular , the price is right , but the location was awesome ."
Location Location Location
Right in the middle walking distance from everything !!
2 . Staff is amazing and have great advice on restaurants and places to visit .
Complimentary water bottles are refill stations on every floor as well as coffee on level
Great Location
Great room - compl . upgraded was provided to us so we had 2 queen beds and 2 bathrooms so the room was very spaces and was always kept clean .
"Hello Helen D ,"
Hotel is in the perfect location in the city centre .
Only issue with my room was that it looked out towards trump tower - not exactly what you want to wake up to each day .
Stayed for a weekend trip in Chicago .
Thank you for choosing Chicago River Hotel during your recent travels .
Walking distance to Millennium Park .
We are also glad to hear you found the staff to be amazing as we pride ourselves on our service .
We are delighted to hear you enjoyed your complimentary upgrade and enjoyed the extra space .
We are very lucky to be right in the middle of the city and within walking distance to all major attractions .
We look forward to seeing you again next time you come to Chicago !
Busy town .
"Comfy, clean, great river view, loved it.."
Ever been to Paris Kind of like that .
Everything is in walking distance so park the car and just walk .
Great river view .
It 's located in the heart of downtown so traffic is chaotic .
Just ask for it .
No point in driving .
Parking is expensive .
Room was nice and comfy !
Self park is 24 in the public parking w/ validation around the corner from the hotel .
Stayed here for one night passing through .
Valid parking is 43 .
We loved it .
Ask for a room higher up and enjoy the great view !
"Cool place, great staff!"
"Great things that made up for the smaller size ( and my boyfriend is 6 ' 2 and had No problem with the hotel at all ! ) are the small kitchenette , with coffee maker and supplies for morning java , the bathroom and it 's nice shower , and the bed was very comfortable !"
"My boyfriend and I stayed here based on the reviews on this site , which I can usually depend on -- and again , they were right !"
"Once more , the staff here will do everything in their power to make your stay wonderful !"
"Remember that you are not moving in for good , and once you get in the room , you will find you have all the space you need !"
"The hotel is very nice inside , the location is prime , and the staff is one of the Best we have ever encountered , and I have travelled worldwide ."
"The rooms are smaller , but if you think about it , what is missing is the vast expanse between the side of the bed and the main window , and who uses that Anyway !"
"There is also a nice desk in the room , for your laptop ."
"There is also a small cafe in front of the hotel that had a very good breakfast , and looked busy at night with casual cocktails and Italian food that looked great ."
"We were not disturbed by any noises , nor elevator troubles , in the least ."
"We Will be going back , and we will be staying at CQ !"
Location is central .
"Stylish rooms, excellent staff, excellent location"
"The hotel provides unlimited cold , filtered water and bottles for you to put the water in ."
The restaurant has a great mushroom with mozarella de bufalo and risotto appetizer .
The rooms are smallish but up - to - date .
The staff is friendly and accomodating .
The views from the river view rooms are spectacular ( we were on the 7th floor ) .
"They also have coffee , coffee maker , microwave and refrigerator ."
"Very clean and sleek , two of us did not feel cramped ."
You really can not ask for a better hotel !
"Great hotel, best value, awesome location"
"She was awesome , very helpful and accommodating ."
"The room was clean , and we had the best view of the river !"
We can not be more than happy with Tania at the front desk !!
We stayed for two nights when we ran the RNR Half Marathon this past weekend .
We were extremely satisfied about our stay .
We will definitely stay here again .
"I am 71 , have been travelling around the world all my life , and your hotel is the worst experience ever ."
I arrived Friday Sep 9th at 2.45 pm .
I gave two trousers to be washed and ironed .
I had to claim them the following morning .
I know that the check - in time is 3 pm but no room was available and I had to wait till 3.15 !
My room has been booked through Booking.com for one month .
No luggage rack in this tiny room and I had to call three times before I got one ( check the records of the Housekeepers phone )
No one would ever propose to give me a hand !
Nothing .
"She had to go elsewhere to find the suitable breakfast tea , and I had to claim for sugar which was not on the table ."
So I went to the reception desk who gave me another room .
That does nt fit with what is written on the laundry service paper .
"That was done at 8.30 and I was supposed to have them back by 6 , that evening ."
"The first room was on the 28th floor , the 2nd on the 4th so I had to repack and go from one room to the other 3 times THRU THE LOBBY , because the elevators are not the same ."
The Housekeeper sent someone who was unable to fix that .
"The waitress brought me tea with bergamote , which is not a tea in which you can put milk ."
The water was cold ( around 30 degrees Celsius ) .
"This morning , I ordered black tea with milk in the Coffee Shop downstairs ."
"When I came back at 6 pm after having walked in the city , I wanted to take a shower ."
Worst hotel ever
2 . It was annoying to learn only while checking out that this is a time share hotel .
"3 . The WIFI was slow , and unreliable , cutting out from time to time ."
"4 . The Business Center has two PCs that are excruciatingly slow , and a printer as well that lumbers along ."
5 . The single bright light in this business experience is that the staff were unfailingly polite and did their best to help .
"Also , when it tried to upgrade to the offered higher speed WIFI , it was quite an ordeal that took about 90 minutes and a call to the help line at your WIFI vendor ."
"BTW , you might try the user interface for that sign up - it exasperatingly erases all one 's data entries if a single one of them is incorrect ( eg if you generate an unacceptable password )"
I did not like the experience of dealing with the Expedia person who assisted with the reservation .
"I give them credit for trying , and for being nice to me ."
No one told me .
Not yet ready for business travellers
"Old , slow , out of date ."
Near Union Square and Nob Hill .
Nice apartment hotel
This is a nice timeshare apartment .
We like to have more than just a bedroom .
Annoying Traveldesk
"Good location , nice place .... but make sure to avoid the travel desk upon arrival , they only push ( hard ) to make you attending 2 hour presentation against free breakfast , selling or promoting Whyndham club ."
"Guess the lady at the travel desk get a good commission for each person she signs up for this breakfast meeting , would not let us go unless we signed up on spot after arrival ... tired and after a long day travelling it was quite annoying ."
Relax and enjoy the city
Such a pleasant play to stay and enjoy SF
"Definitely recommend this place , but we never answered the phone because we read the warnings about time share pestering ."
Excellent location and very comfortable accommodations .
Great place to stay while visiting San Fran
Plenty of good restaurants within walking distance .
This unit had a very efficient use of space for a family of four ( two young adults ) .
"Trader Joes was only a couple of blocks away , so it was easy to pick up a few staples for breakfast ."
I would definite recommend this hotel for business travelers and pleasure travelers .
Quiet and eclean hotel
Rooms were very quiet .
The hotel property and rooms were very clean .
The suite set up of the rooms are perfect for families .
After going back and forth with the manager she is now going to call Hotels.com to resolve which she should have done in the beginning .
After waiting at the counter for over 20 minutes while the attendant the manager finally came over and gave us keys and assured it is fine the rate is the same and enjoy the stay .
During check out and they told me I had a balance .
I booked and paid in full via Hotels.com .
I had to show them the paid in full email and remind them of what I was told when checking in .
I will never stay here again and it s a shame because the facility and location were very nice .
On the way to the room we were greeted by a lady attempting to sell the time shares .
She also tried to bribe us with chocolate which was very juvenile .
That was her sales tactic but standing there with room keys in my hand and not being born yesterday it was apparent she had nothing to do with us checking in .
"The lady was EXTREMELY rude , when we declined the information she made snippy comments like well do n't you want to finish checking in ."
"The rooms were nice and location was fantastic but it s a shame the desk staff does n't have a clue , I will not be returning to this chain and also will push my friends and family to avoid it as well ."
When I arrived and checked in their system messed something up and had a missing day in the middle of our 4 night stay .
Wont stay here again and its a shame
And it 's only a couple blocks to Union Square .
Better Than An Ordinary Room!
Canterbury at San Francisco
"Good Morning JudyZ24 , We appreciate the time to comment on your stay with us ."
I was happy to read that you enjoyed your room and the amenities that we provided during your stay .
"It included a small kitchenette with a dining table , a sitting area , and a separate bedroom ."
"Regards , Matthew JonesGeneral ManagerWyndham"
This would be a great place for a small family !
We hope that you will come back to stay with us again soon .
We loved our room at Wyndham Canterbury !
"While there were only two of us , we certainly enjoyed the extra space ."
Comfortable Clean
If the Internet connection got 10 better
It would have sucked !
Nice Value...but
"And hey , if you want to pay for a room and then spend two hours of your time at a time share meeting , more power to you ."
"And I tried to be polite about it , because I believe in treating people in the service industry as you want to be treated ."
"And now , a month later , I just got a call from the hotel group , again trying to get me to go to a time share meeting ."
And the first lady seemed cool about it .
"And when the same woman calls me up the next night in my room to try and pressure me again into going to this meeting , I just had no patience for it ."
"By the fifth time I 'm saying no , I start to not feel so polite ."
Do you want a time share?
I did n't pay for a hotel room to be pressured to buy a time share .
I do n't .
I do n't like being pressured into something I say no to .
I hated that they repeatedly badgered me about a stupid time share meeting .
I loved the room .
I loved the size and the cleanliness .
I still said no .
I understood it was part of her job and politely told her that I was n't interested .
"If it had n't been for that , I 'd have had no problem being a repeat customer ."
"Luckily , the guy was way more understanding and only made me say no once ."
"My complaint is that after you check in , they take you over to their concierge desk and proceed to try and sell you on a time share meeting ."
She proceeded to get really patronizing .
Then what seemed to be her supervisor came over and offered me free stuff to go to the meeting .
Location Location Location
"This hotel or what they call themselves motel poses an excellent location in the downtown , with fair value you will not find competitive hotel has the same or near value , free parking is a big bonus , Staff are very polite and treat you as family member"
Best deal in downtown Atlanta
But they have all that at the Hilton next door and all over downtown Atlanta so Motel 6 does n't need it !!!
For the same location !
"Granted , the staff at Motel 6 is small - there is no room service , no restaurant , and no bar at Motel 6 ."
I felt as safe as anywhere else I have stayed in Atlanta .
"I stayed at this Motel 6 , 311 Courtland St NE , Atlanta , GA , in August last year for a conference my job would not fund ."
I was totally on my own dime and so needed to economize .
I will stay at this Motel 6 every time I have to go to Atlanta from now on .
"My room at the Motel 6 was clean , the bed was comfortable , the parking was FREE , AND I had a small balcony off my room on the 2nd floor !"
"The conference hotel was the Hilton literally next door , and those poor schmucks over there were paying over three times what I paid !"
The location is perfect .
The staff was nice - what I saw of them .
What a great deal this place was !
What a sweet deal !
"Basic cheap motel quality beds , old TVs , frustrating elevator that takes forever to close and absolutely NO FRILLS ."
Basic. Basic. Basic.
For a healthy restaurant nearby I recommend Metrofresh - it 's less than a ten minute drive and totally worth it !
Got it for 53 / night using a coupon code on the Motel6 website .
Place is n't in the greatest area ( downtown Atlanta is kind of sketchy at night ) but is centrally located .
This place is as basic an accommodation as you can get in downtown Atlanta while still being suitable .
Yes there is free parking but this place is so cheap that they do n't even give you free shampoo in the bathroom - just two little bars of facial soap .
I stay in a lot of Motel 6s and have been satisfied with just about all of them I 've tried .
I walked both day and night and never felt in danger though I did have to deal with a couple of panhandlers .
No surprise there .
The location is great -- I walked to World of Coca - Cola and some good restaurants -- and the free parking helps make it a real bargain .
The place is clean and well maintained and t staff was pleasant and helpful .
This one is a notch above the typical Motel 6 .
Top tier Motel 6 in a great location
Efficient and great value
For very reasonable price and 1 night stay you ca n't wish for better
It was outrageous Wifi was great and coffee available .
"Room spacious and clean , heater efficient but pretty noisy , noise from corridor is also there Service could be better - at 0130 at night got a phone call from night manager to immediately re-park the car ( evening manager allowed the parking at particular slot ) ."
Somehow my booking.com reservation have not reached the hotel so had to wait about half an hour while it was submitted again .
"Great Location, Great Rooms - JUST NOISY!"
"However , between the hours of 2 - 5 the front desk staff were incredibly noisy EVERY day ( I was here for a week ) ."
I stayed here for Americas Mart was excited about the fresh paint cleanliness of my room .
"It is more expensive for a Motel 6 , but again , the location is great ."
It was very frustrating .
( This should have been my first clue to leave . )
Both the room and the building were not satisfactory .
Do Yourself a Favor and Stay At Another Hotel!
"Furthermore , the hotel clerk stated that if the room was not satisfactory that I could leave without being charged ."
"However , the Marriott gave me a free breakfast each morning compared to Motel 6 only serving coffee ."
I booked my reservation on Motel 6 's website .
I have never heard of such nonsense .
I just disputed the charge with my credit card company and received an instant refund .
I wanted to get out of there so badly that I did not argue with the hotel clerk .
It was 90 degrees in Atlanta on my visit and my room as well as the hallway in the building was hot and was not as comfortable as it should have been .
"Lastly , the amount of money that the hotel wanted to charge me was 18.00 higher than the amount I was quoted when I made my reservation ."
My credit card was charged for one night 's stay .
So for the reasons cited above is why I would not recommend this hotel .
The hotel clerk refused my request and stated that it is the companys policy NOT to allow a person to see a room until after checking in first .
The hotel clerk refused to change the sheets and stated that if I wanted them changed that I had to remove the sheets myself .
The hotel clerk stated that after I have checked in that I could inspect the room .
The ice machine in the building hallway was in desperate need of repair because it was making an extremely loud humming sound that could be hear all the way down the corridor .
The Motel 6 hotel clerk did not refund me the full amount of the charge to my credit card account .
The sheets on the bed needed to be changed .
"Thus , with the bad conditions as well as the bad attitude of the staff , I left Motel 6 the SAME DAY and checked into the Marriott for just 7.00 more than what Motel 6 was charging per night ."
Upon arriving I requested to see my room before checking in .
Also a plus is that you can get free coffee at the reception area every morning from about 7 am .
Check in staff was very polite and check in went very smooth .
Excellent value for money!
I will surely stay here again when visiting Atlanta !
Me and my partner stayed at the Motel 6 Downtown Atlanta beginning of september 2015 .
Our room also had a small balcony where you can relax in the morning and evenings when it is not to hot outside ...
Overal the Motel 6 downtown is a basic but very good motel in downtown Atlanta with clean rooms and friendly staff .
Rooms are clean with a nice bathroom .
"That is very easy when you arrive ' jet laged ' from Europe and wake up much to early each morning -) Location of the Motel 6 is perfect because you can do all the tourist places like the Coca Cola museum , the Olypic parc etc by foot ."
The Motel 6 is excellent value for money !
"They also have a car park at site at no extra cost , so that was also very easy to park our rental car there ."
We were visiting Atlanta for a couple days as we were on route to Fort Lauderdale and slept 2 night at the Motel 6 .
( Side note : the rate was higher than I 've ever paid this time .
Adrianna was ghetto .
"Again , before this stay I 've never had these concerns ."
Consistency is key..had better experiences until today.
He said he could lie because I lied on his front desk agent I simply shared how she acted .
I 'm currently on the line with customer service seeking resolution .
I 've stayed at this property several times and was pleasantly satisfied .
"I simply needed a place to sleep , wash , and change for conferences that keep me out of the room more than in ."
I would think they customer service would match ) .
Jay told a lie to the customer service agent and said he gave me time to make arrangements .
"Jay was trying to be professional in his t-shirt and jeans , even trying to correct my English ."
"Mu ,"
"Our staff aims to provide the highest level of hospitality to our guests through our customer service , but with your experience , we have fallen short and would like to apologize for the service issues you describe ."
"Please know the service issues you describe are an exception to our guest commitment , and as such , we apologize ."
Thank you for sharing your concerns .
"Unfortunately , this session was horrible ."
We invite you to contact our Guest Relations at 1-855-787-9864 to record the details of your visit to help us provide a better guest experience in the future .
"It was noted the expensive hotels seem to have walkways above the pavements to avoid the riffraff , although I did n't really like the idea of rising above everyone else to be honest ."
Nice central hotel
Nothing against the hotel ( it 's next to a Hilton who would have the same issue ) but there are a lot of homeless in the area although they generally did n't cause much issue .
"Only a 5 min walk to Marta stations and downtown areas , 10 mins to the Olympic park area ."
"Stayed two nights , was greeted by Ben who was very helpful throughout our meetings during our stay , nicest hotel staff we had on our 2 week trip ."
"The room has been refurbished but it 's lacking coffee in the room , it 's available by the front desk though ."
Could n't hear hallway noise .
Free parking in downtown Atlanta is unheard of .
"Gave cleanliness a 4 cuz comforter smelled musty , but everything else was perfect ."
"If you do n't mind missing the extra common area atmosphere , swimming pool , pricey restaurants , etc and just want a clean safe modern room with all the necessary amenities and free parking , come here ."
"Motel 6 immediately next door to Hilton and Marriott Marquis , but a third the price ."
My dog was allowed at no extra cost .
Nice new fridge and microwave in room .
Overall a 4 cuz of no extras besides the nice room and free parking .
Room was quiet .
"Rooms as nice as Hilton, third of the cost. Same location. Missing only nice lobby and toiletries."
"The common areas are older and outdated , but rooms are surprisingly nice ."
The rooms are actually really nice and updated .
Always a pleasant stay
Bath amenities in shower are in dispensers .
Check - in was friendly and fast .
Free parking if you have a car and free airport shuttle if you fly .
Great shower head !
Rooms are spacious and nicely decorated .
"Single - serve coffee maker , hair dryer , free long distance calls ..."
Soap bars at sink .
Spent the night here with spouse .
Very comfortable beds with nice linens .
"Also , you have to have a key card to access their customer parking area ."
I can not recall the last time I had an issue at a Drury Inn.
It was a nice feature which prevents people with ill intentions from driving around scoping out the scene .
Last room at the Inn
"Next , their complimentary breakfast was good , as well as their late afternoon meal from 5 PM 7 PM ."
"The room was comfortable , the staff was attentive and helpful , and it was nicely priced more importantly , we got the last available room for the evening ."
"Well , we did not have one at this location ."
Drury Inn was a great place to stay .

Free airport parking and a great bed
I need to try and get one for my house .
I parked for free for a week .
I was looking for a place to stay near the airport and park my car for the duration of our trip .
"Kind regards ,"
Thank you for your business and we look forward to serving you in the future !
Thank you for your stay and kind words .
The bed was probably the most comfortable hotel bed I 've slept on !
We are happy you enjoyed our stay and fly package .
We recently replaced our mattresses during our renovation and have enjoyed very good feedback .
Breakfast was good .
Got a king room for special rate .
Had late flight in so unable to comment on evening snacks and drinks .
NICE PLACE TO STAY IF AT REDUCED RATE
"Room was nice and clean , however , would not stay here if not for the special rate received ."
Great hotel and grounds and easy drive from the airport .
Great service and amenities with excellent value for the charge!
One of the nicest hotel chains I have stayed in for this price range .
"Also , it would be great if the hotel had a luggage scale ."
Also worth noting : I never heard an airplane during the night .
Breakfast : awesome !
Co n
Cons :
Great airport hotel
Great staff !
Hopefully my car is safe .
"I was worried that staying so close to the airport would be loud , but it was n't at all ."
I would definitely stay here again !
If not I 'll edit this review to reflect any issues .
In fact he got off the bus at the airport to unload our luggage and explained step - by - step how to get to the international terminal .
"Like it was almost backed up , but it would still flush a little ."
Park fly parking area is closed off and well - lit .
Pros : Super friendly staff .
Room : huge room with great a/c .
Sausage and eggs were delicious .
Then the guy that shuttled us to the airport the next morning was just as friendly .
"There was some dried soap on the shower wall that probably should have been cleaned before we checked in , but it 's just soap , so no big deal ."
They had so many choices !
Two tvs and plenty of storage space .
We had an issue with the plumbing in our room .
We spent 1 night here before a flight out of Atlanta .
"We were only there from 8 pm to 6 am so I ca n't say whether this was ongoing or resolved , but the toilet did n't flush well ."
When we checked in the lady in reception was immediately welcoming and happy to answer my questions .
It s an older hotel and the room was darker and smaller than expected .
Just okay. Good food and nice staff though.
Located directly across from the airport so it is super convenient for air travel .
Overall basic and okay place to stay just no visual thrills or excitement .
The breakfast provided was very nice and they made upgrades to the bathroom .
Car was broken into and they refuse to pay for the damages .
do not stay here do not trust them .
No responsibility .
Stayed at this hotel with their package deal of renting a room and leaving your car in the parking lot for a price of 159.99 while you fly away .
Thank you for your response .
"Unfortunately , the airport market has had a recent wave of car vandalism ."
We understand how frustrating this situation is and again would like to extend our apologies .
"We want you to know that we will continue to work with local police to ensure our hotel , parking lot and city are safe ."
"With the help of police and third party security monitoring our parking lot , we fortunately have been able to stop these car break - ins ."
worst hotel customer service
For some reason the note about connecting rooms was n't in the reservation .
Quiet and clean with good service
The clerk apologized ...
The front desk clerk was a very nice lady .
We arrived in Atlanta on a Saturday around 9 pm for a one night stay during a cross country trip .
We had two rooms booked and called ahead a few days prior to specifically request connecting rooms .
Best customer service!
I had a problem turning my TV on - the lady at the desk came to my room to set it up .
Sign in the lobby indicates they are going to start renovations soon - which are much needed - hotel was dated .
Stopped here for an overnight traveling through Atlanta .
The desk clerks at night were excellent .
"All the guests we met while there had smiles on their faces , I 'm sure it was because of the great atmosphere Drury staff created ."
Amazing hotel! We always check for Drury Inns when we travel now!
"My daughter loved the pool , and it was kept up nicely ."
Not having to leave for dinner or breakfast was a huge plus .
"The staff was so friendly and welcoming , the rooms are comfortable , beautiful and clean ."
We stayed for one night while passing through on the way to Florida .
What a great experience !
"Even on the fifth floor , the noise from breakfast diners begins at 7:00 AM ..."
"It was good value for money , with a spacious and comfortable room that was in great shape ."
Just what was needed
My Dad and I stayed here for two nights while visiting Atlanta for the Chick Fil - A kickoff game between Louisville and Auburn .
The bathroom was spotless and seemed new .
"Frankly , my wife and I were thinking that we wouldve been better off just trying to sleep at the airport terminal then spend the night here ."
"I m not sure if I ll be other reviewers are used to sleeping in tents , because I do nt understand why it would be so great about this place ."
"If your travels ever bring you to Atlanta again , we would love to have you back as our guest ."
"It has a feeling of age about it , like it was built 30 years ago and trying to look modern but failing ."
Justina H.General Manager

Thank you for taking the time to provide us feedback about your stay !
"Warm Regards ,"
We just had our exterior renovated in April 2018 and we look forward to getting an interior refresh soon .
We like to think that so many of our guests give us great reviews because of our exemplary service .
"While I ve stayed in the worse hotel rooms , there s certainly nothing distinctive for attractive about this place ."
GOOD EXPERIENCE!!
I will be recommending to family and friends .
I will be seeking out other Drury locations .
Job well done .!!!!
"My stay at the Drury Inn , Atlanta was most enjoyable ."
The food was good and the hotel was very clean .
"The staff was quite courteous , polite and accomadating ."
Biggest complaint was with Travelocity .
Definitely recommend
Even though there were several high school aged groups who were there during our stay ... room was very quiet and no complaints with noise and everything was clean and well stocked .
Every staff member we came in contact with was extremely helpful and friendly .
"Hot breakfast and dinner every day .... dinner consisted of baked potato , cheddar cheese sause , hot dogs , salad and carrots , celery sticks every night ."
"In addition , each night , there was at least one or more additional items - nachos / chicken tenders / etc ."
My grandson was coming up for the weekend from his military base so it presented a little bit of a problem for one night .
Not a real problem .... we just went to the lobby and used the tables there .
"On the sunny days , outside pool was nice ."
Only negatives
Overall ... excellent experience .
Shuttle was efficient - ran every half hour .
Staff was EXCELLENT .
The pool was ok ... a little smaller than pictured and chilly but the room was heated and the indoor / outdoor feature was nice .
"The room had a desk , reclining chair and two dressers ."
The rooms were clean and beds extremely comfortable .
Their comment was they could n't guarantee the room and we would just have to see if we could talk to the front desk .
There were several soccer ball teams here when we checked in so there were no roll - away beds .
They were supposed to reserve a double bed room and booked us into a single king .
We arrived early in the morning and they were able to give us our room which was extremely nice .
We made do but it would have been better if they had made the reservation correctly to begin with .
Will not book through them again .
Would have preferred a table with chairs over the 2nd dresser so we could play games in the room .
"As said in the title , I do n't have a single negative thing to say about this hotel ."
"Every member of the staff was as nice as can possibly be , rooms are nice housekeeping does a great job , and the complimentary breakfast AND dinner were delicious ."
"Great location right by the airport easy in easy out , and there are some great restaurants within walking distance ."
Not One Negative Thing to Say
Not to mention the complimentary dinner includes ( 3 ) drinks .
"great accomodations , friendly staff , affordable , clean , ample parking , etc."
highly reccomend Drury
very family friendly .
we have stayed at the drury near the Atlanta airport for the last 3 years .
will continue to stay here when I have to go to Atlanta
Absolutely would stay again
"After an unexpected overnight delay at the Atlanta airport , I was greeted by friendly staff , a clean room and comfy bed !"
The shuttle service was timely and the driver friendly and helpful !
Would absolutely stay here again !
Do not get park and fly!
"Fortunately with the help of local police and third party security monitoring our parking lot , we have been able to stop the vandalism ."
Had to drive 5 hours home without window through cold temperatures and some rain .
Hotel did not offer .
"If you have any further questions or concerns , please let us know and we are happy to be of assistance ."
"In the case of a car break - in , we contact and hand over to the local police department for further investigation ."
Needless to say we will not be staying here again .
Staff is friendly .
The driver 's side window had been shattered and someone tried to rip the door handle off .
The hotel did cover the hole .
The hotel is not bad .
They came out took pictures etc. hotel apologized and refunded our room for the one night park and fly .
They did call the police department .
This year we purchased park and fly package and left our car there while away on vacation .
"Unfortunately , there has been a recent wave of car break - ins around the airport , affecting a number of hotels in the area ."
We appreciate hearing from our guests and thank you for your feedback .
We had to find a vacumn and vacumn the vehicle .
We have stayed at several times .
We offer our sincerest apologies and are glad we had a chance to discuss the situation with you directly .
We returned to the hotel to find the vehicle had been broken into .
We were very disappointed to hear your car was broken into while in our gated parking lot and understand how frustrating this is .
"We work diligently to create a safe environment for our guests and will continue to work with local police to ensure our hotel , parking lot and city are safe ."
"Even on the fifth floor , the noise from breakfast diners begins at 7:00 AM and is rather loud in rooms near the atrium , so if you want more quiet , request a room further away ."
"It was good value for money , with a spacious and comfortable room that was in great shape ."
Just what was needed
My Dad and I stayed here for two nights while visiting Atlanta for the Chick Fil - A kickoff game between Louisville and Auburn .
The bathroom was spotless and seemed new .
"In other words , the people the employees are a match for the Drury brand , as their personalities are what I want to see in a hotel ."
The people are awesome
"The staff are not only well trained , they are well hired ."
"These folks have a big job , as for many they offer the first impression ..."
"They are friendly , but not cold and ' all business . '"
First I want to say we had amazing customer service !
"However , the heated indoor pool was not on ."
"I will stay at Drury again , but not this one !"
"The food , another reason we choose Drury , was not edible ."
the shuttle was on time to the airport and the driver helped us with our bags ( tip him too ! )
The Worst Drury Accommodations Thus Far
"There was popcorn made once a day , around 10 am , and there it sat all day ."
"They let us check in our bags early , the maid service was great ( we tip them , you should too ! )"
"This is my main reason for choosing Drury , since I have children who love to swim ."
We were disappointed .
All - in - all it was an excellent stay and very good value !
I had to turn the AC on to get a comfortable temp .
Nice room and great staff!
Stayed in this hotel last week .
The bartender poured good drinks and it was a good opportunity to meet some of the other hotel guests and the hotel staff .
"The hotel offered lots of extras for free such as free hot breakfast , drinks in the evening , hot dinner , and long distance calls ."
The manager and staff were very nice and friendly .
The manager made it a point to stop at tables and talk to guests and get to know them .
The only item that could be considered a complaint was that even with the heat off my room was hot .
"The room was clean ( even behind stuff ) , the bed was comfortable , and it was quiet ."
"While the food was bland and tastelss , it was there for anyone that did not want to go out for decent tasting food ."
I did feel sorry for the check in girl .
I do n't understand how this hotel is getting such good reviews .
"Let me just say , we could n't wait to get out of here and preferred to wait hours in the airport to staying in the hotel ."
"She was alone and it was very busy , but she was very polite and nice ."
The only time TA ever let me down
"Breakfast , though crowded this day , was good and well stocked ."
Great stay and parking free
One employee was even helping people make waffles .
"That seemed fair enough , and we had no problems with our car while it was parked at the hotel for 3 nights ."
The location was very convenient to the airport ( right off I - 85 ) and the free shuttle service brought us right back to the hotel in minutes .
"The staff was friendly and the rooms were clean , and spacious ."
We love Drury Inns and were pleased with our stay in Atlanta .
"We only had to fill out a form , which did clearly state that the hotel is not liable for any damages ."
We were also pleased that we could park for up to 7 days for free ( subject to available space ) .
45 minutes later I went downstairs .
Called front desk :
Cockroach with no assistance
Have a nice night .
"I replied that I thought I was a customer too , only to be told :"
I voiced my complaint and was told they were busy with a customer .
Last time for us at a Drury .
"Maintenance is gone for the day , so I 'll try to get up in 10 minutes ."
Room 627 .
"Room was in terrible shape : cigarette burns in the carpet , upholstered chair looked so worn it was dirty ."
"Sixth floor , no less ."
Two people were at the desk checking in another party .
We 're completely booked tonight or I would move you to another room .
We shut the window curtain only to be faced with a large cockroach .
"We stayed July 11 , 2005 ."
"Decor not much , but decent size room ."
Great Value
The 4 - star rating is for the staff and extra's .
The staff could n't have been nicer or friendlier .
"There was nice green , tossed ( fresh ) salad , soup , chili , hot dog bar , nacho bar , Italian pasta , chicken fingers , cheese , fruit , and one to two other items I do not remember ."
"They have nice amenities -- indoor / outdoor pool , small fitness room , but very nice and accommodating hot breakfast ( free ) AND free Happy Hour with 3 drinks each AND hot and cold appetizer buffet , which was enough to eat as dinner ."
Thought it was a nice extra for what you would normally pay for a hotel .
We evacuated to this hotel ahead of Hurrican Irma from Florida .
What I ate was good -- did not try chicken fingers .
My family and I decided to stay overnight before our departure to Jamaica .
Near the airport
The morning of our departure we had a quick breakfast in the lobby and a shuttle service was arranged to take us to the airport .
The rooms were clean and spacious and cocktail hour was enjoyable .
We decided to take off the stress of getting our teens up early and rushing through morning traffic .
We live about 50 miles from the airport so we could have driven to the airport .
We made the right decision to stay at the Drury Inn .
+ FREE PARKING and FREE WIFI too !
Both the grandkids are allergic to smoke and it really hurts my sinuses too .
For the price you just can not beat this hotel !!
Friendly staff !!
I had originally booked a different cheaper hotel ( Country Inn ) but when I walked in to check on the rooms I decided to look for something else that also had an indoor pool since the CI suites had no window in the Living area .
I will certainly stay here again on a quick layover to Atlanta .
"Lots of food - breakfast with lots of choices , snack in the afternoon ( popcorn and free soda ) and a food bar in the evening including FREE drinks ."
On a two day layover to see my grandkids I stayed here in one of the King suites .
Recommend! Staff is very welcoming!!! Will stay here again!
Simple foods but VERY acceptable !
Since the vents are connected in the rooms we were smelling the smoke .
The atmosphere in the hotel was perfect for us .
The space there was also very small .
The staff moved us to our choice of a new room ( not sure why the exhaust vents in hotels are now connected but just saw that in a Hilton I stayed in recently too ) .
The tween grandids really enjoyed the HEATED POOL .
They are not at all nasty in any way so I do not understand the complaints from others .
This was also a convenient enough location to make a midday trip to the fabulous Aquarium too .
WE ALL HAD A FUN TIME HERE .
We did have a problem with our neighbor smoking in their room although this is clearly stated on signes throughout the hotel that this is a NON SMOKING HOTEL .
"Yes the rooms were older but they are well equipped , very large and very comfortable ."
Better late than never
"I know you get what you pay for however , this hotel was a complete dissapointment and a sour end to an amazing holiday ."
I stayed at this hotel in September 2012 for five nights at the end of my six week honeymoon in North and South America .
It 's on the border of the tenderloin district which is known as the ...
"A little tricky to find the hotel , but very clean ."
nice staff
Only con was that the furniture was a little scuffed .
Staff replaced key card when we lost the original set .
The staff was very friendly and helpful and the continental breakfast buffet was very good .
Fantastic Hotel
The hotel was close to my family who we were visiting .
The staff were outstanding .
"At about 3 miles distant , it 's about 1 mile farther out than the main ' hotel row ' but still close to all the amenities - restauarants , grocery stores , etc ."
Fine for a night. Good price and location.
Good price for location - a Midway airport hotel .
No complaints .
Nothng to write home about either .
"The hotel was showing its age a little but was comfortable , quiet and adequate ."
Dead bolt did not work but someone did fix it .
Front desk was not helpful .
I found this out the second night I was there when a different person was at the desk .
Never told me breakfast was free in resturant .
"not the best, but reasonable"
"But the room was v clean well stocked , with an attentive room service lady ."
Good place !!
Just stayed overnight enroute to my daughters college campus .
Neighborhood I was not sure about -- was told it was safer to stay in after hours !
V comfortable .
Everything to make that weekend easy and fun was close at hand .
Great Location
"I was meeting a friend coming in at Midway , and being able to shop at the mall right next door , and eat at an IHOP , also right next door in that mall ..."
"Plus I had to remind myself where I was when I woke up each morning , because the bed was firm , like my own bed at home , so I was very comfortable ."
Since
And we did tip the driver ........ a wonderful place to stay for early morning flights out of Midway .
good hotels
The staff was very professional and Helpful I loved the restaurant .... and the free shuttle service ....
Breakfast was tasty .
One night at the Clarion
The bed was very comfortable and the room was very clean .
"There was no guide in the room ( the book that outlines amenities , important locations , area restaurants , etc ) and I found the wireless to be quite slow ."
. doing renovations on 2nd floor .
Awesome experience
I also stayed an extra 2 days just bc of the staff ... would recommend this suite to anyone
Love the stay .. got off to a rocky start .
Major problem ... but told staff and the accommodations were fantastic ... 5th floor suite stay from there ...
Terrific
Very nice
As soon as we walked into the room you could smell the smoke from someone prior .
I alerted the front desk and was offered to have someone spray the room .
I booked a non smoking and at check in we were told that if there is any smoking in the room it is a $ 200 charge .
stinky room
what good does that do .
Met our expectations
Met our expectations .
It is a good value and close to Midway Airport.
"It was a short trip , but made very comfortable by the clean room , free breakfast , large breakfast room and the free shuttle to Midway Airport ."
Clean room .
Close to Midway airport
Housekeeping started cleaning at 6:00 AM .
"Although the hotel was close to MDW , the hotel was pretty old ."
I did n't think it was worth the money we paid .
Not very good
That is not a big deal but the carpet is .
"The carpet in our room was pretty bad , it was sticky and needed immediate replacement ."
The furniture had seen better days .
The hotel certainly needs TLC in many areas to keep it competitive .
The noise level was also high as it is right next to the main thoroughfare .
They could have included that in the price we paid for the room .
They were charging 8.50 for breakfast .
Very happy
"Was a nice hotel for the area , not too loud even though on a busy street ."
Not a 3 star more like 2 star .
Old style room .
Over Priced
Small room no fridge or micro .
"Check - in was a breeze , room was great and we loved the pillows ."
Clarion experience
Close to the aiport and a good rate per night .
"Everything else , was enough for the price ."
Excellent for CTA Orange Line Midway location.
WiFi was not any good .
Decent hotel near Chicago Midway
It is not fancy but is not dirty or run down .
This is a basic hotel near the airport .
Clarion Hotel
"Comfortable and clean enough , but does need renovation ."
Good location - close to shopping and airport .
Good value for the price .
It was very close to the airport
It was very easy to reach the airport with free transportation and a on site restaurant to get a quick meal early in the am .i
"Close to Midway airport , great shuttle service , good interiors for the price ."
Convenient choice by Midway Airport
Would readily stay again .
"Bad : Mattresses too hard , carpet on lobby too old ."
Good : Locarion

Good : The worst customer service I ever had .
He actually was yelling at me I had to call booking . com
In life .
The front dest worker was very disrespectful unhelpful .
The worst customer service I ever had.
Bad : Breakfast is exactly the same every day and if you spend there 3 or more days you need a little wider choice .
Good :
I liked the hotel and the area.
"The hotel has an excellent location , and is in walking distance from the beach ."
"The staff is kind , the room is fine and clean , the coffee is good , considering the prices this is a good choice ."

Good :
Great little spot in the heart of South Beach.
I 'd stay again .
The hint of disinfectant in the lobby is not inviting .
"Well located , friendly staff , quiet and clean , all at an affordable price ."
"Bad : At the arrival , we paid the parking fee in cash ( 43 ) and the rest of the amount for two nights stay with a credit card ."
"Basically no choice for breakfast - consisted of two types of cereal , boiled eggs , white and whole grain bread ."
Checking the transactions during the last couple of days we realized that the parking fee has been charged on the credit card TOO .
Coffee machine available at all the time free.
Good : Coffee machine available at all the time free .
It 's simply unacceptable .
"The room furniture is old , need a renovation ."
The space around all windows - both in the room and the shower - and the windows themselves were very dirty .
We asked for an explanation and have not received any answer at all .
Bad : Carpet was dirty and old .
Good : Location
Location
Bad : The day shift would n't believe me that something was wrong with the room door lock and made me re-key .
Both attitude and cleanliness could be better. Stained carpet and cobwebs.
Good :
I was still locked out of my room for 30 to 45 minutes .
"Lastly , I never could figure out how to make the steam shower work , but after the episode with the door I decided it was n't worth asking ."
"The night shift desk was helpful and once she realized she 'd made a mistake , she went about solving the problem as quickly as she could ."
"Then , they sent the cleaning staff to ' open my door for me ' only to discover that the electronic key system wo n't work if the batteries in the lock have n't been replaced ."
Bad : Nothing bad . .
Good : Great location .
Within walking distance to everything we wanted to see .
Wonderful time
Also had to be careful about not hitting my head on the edge of the TV that was mounted on the wall between the sleeping area and the bathroom area .
Bad : The ' bathroom ' area was open to the sleeping area .
"Comfortable room, but watch your head."
Good :
It was a unique design and certainly made the room seem larger .
It was just a little odd .
The room was very spacious and the bed was quite comfortable .
We were only there for the night but it was a pleasant stay .
Bad : Scam more charge of parking and take from my credit card without telling me .
Bad experience
Good : Location
Bad : Advertised amenities came up majorly short .

Many people were either female or elderly who need that kind of support .
Nice staff
Bad : Best days of this hotel are far behind and the interior would need a major upgrade .
Good : Good location .
Good bed .
The air condition was extreamely noisy .
There was a comlimentary coffee machine available at the lobby .
We were a bit disappointed for the quality of the hotel.
When you enter the Room you first notice a bad smell due to combination of moisture and lack of proper ventilation .
You can also hear all voices from the corridor and other rooms .

Beautiful Hotel
I recently stayed at the beautiful Hotel Royal and it was great !
I will warn you that they did have the smallest shower I have ...
"The room was a bit on the small side , but it 's just a place to sleep so that was n't a huge issue ."
"The room was clean , the staff was friendly and the location was fantastic !"
"Air conditioned rooms , free ..."
I stayed in a petite room - but was impressed by the updated and clean rooms / bathrooms .
Perfect location for a great price!
Perfectly located in the French Quarter and 1 block from Bourbon Street .
The hotel was a pleasant surprise .
"Upon arrival , the staff were warm and welcoming - even carried my luggage up the 2 flights of stairs to the room ."
"Courteous staff , nice clean sharp accommodations and a very nice restaurant ."
My wife and I have stayed at the Bay Pointe Inn several times in the past 6 years that we have been married .
Very nice place to stay
We have enjoyed the experience every time .
We stayed there the night of our wedding and as anniversary stays on a couple occasions .
"As a traveling superintendent , I was there for two weeks and had a great stay , the breakfast was a nice bonus , liked that they had a to go breakfast available , and the coffee was good , referred a business associate to stay there he will be staying for 60 + days also"
clean rooms
A Peaceful Evening
I had some things ...
"Oh , by the way , if they could only show where the parking lot is located when you are chosing your room that would be great ."
"Well , we arrived at our hotel and I had done the pre-checking in thing ( like we can do for airplane seating etc ) I had chosen my room and everything was good ."
Home Away from Home
The rooms are clean and comfortable while you are away from home .
The staff and the level of service at this Hampton Inn were amazing .
They are very polite and helpful .
"Whenever I 'm in the Alexandria , VA area , I always choose this Hampton Inn because of the service they provide and the environment while in their facility ."
A real good Hampton .
"Courteous staff , clean .."
Going back
Good restaurants near by .
I 'm stopping there again next week .
Just inside VA and easy on and off .
Needed to get past D.C.
Stayed here a couple of weeks ago on a trip south .
This is very good .
Due to an unforeseen situation I was unable to get there before the wee hours of the morning .
Halloween 2015
"I 'm glad that I had stayed here before because this trip was not too comfortable , at least at first ."
I wanted nothing more than to take a hot shower and crash .
"Luckily , i was ..."
This was my second time at this hotel .
A good room at a good rate .
Good Stay
"I ve seen better breakfast , but I have seen a lot worse ."
"There is plenty of parking , security seems good and the bed was comfortable ."
"It 's not in the most picturesque location , but everything else about it is great ."
It 's rare to find people who will help a stranger .
"Nice hotel, great staff!"
Our hotel room was spotless .
The staff were so helpful and caring .
They helped us out with our car .
We stay here frequently since my daughter goes to Chapman University .
Loved it!!
The beds were comfortable and the TV was great .
"The overall stay was great , the staff I had contact with was great ."
"the room was better than expected , we had the room with 3 beds which has the 3rd bed in it 's own little room which my Daughter and her friend loved ."
We did have a problem with the refrigerator ...
Close to USAFA and lots of good stuff .
"Colleen is the bomb , and will give you wonderful personal service !"
"Great rooms , excellent service , and a sweet breakfast with a make omelettes to order chef !"
Perfect!
This is the sixth time we 've stayed here .
Friendly staff clean and comfortable Surroundings
Great stay
Home away from home Shuttle needs to run at least till midnight shuttle ends at 10 pm
"Bathroom was roomy with great shower head , shower curtain and granite countertop ."
"Nice room , clean and comfortable ."
One of the nicest Super 8's we have stayed .
"They provide a coffee station , refrigerator and microwave ."
We will definitely stay here again while visiting family .
Weekend visit
I will have to find a lower rate in Henderson or I will have to stay in Owensboro where I have a lower rate .
Probably my last stay
The rooms and service are good but my rate went up over what my company wants to pay .
Great Hotel and Staff!
"I am a Marriott person myself , but was pleasantly surprised !"
I stayed here for one night for business .
I would compare it to a Marriott Courtyard !
I would highly recommend it !
"The hot breakfast included eggs , sausage , biscuits , hot cinnamon rolls , pancakes , bagels , toast , etc. and was wonderful !"
The room was very nice and clean and the staff was friendly .
Believe they changed management recently as ...
"Breakfast may be a hit or miss , guess depends on who is preparing the food ."
Depending on where your room is located you can end up with considerable noise from the traffic on 1604 .
"Hotel is clean , staff is friendly ."
recent stay
"Third stay at this hotel , two good stays and last one is so so ."
Always excellent
"Always friendly staff , decent breakfast , comfortable mattress and clean ."
"Easy to find right past Bandera exit off 1604 NW , San Antonio , Tx ."
Never have any problems .
Stay at this hotel about 4 times per year .
Very reliable quality of service .
Easy excess to Highway .
Had good breakfast served in the morning .
Hotel very clean .
Lots of restaurant close to Hotel .

"Breakfast was no bueno , we only tried it one day ."
"I probably wo nt choose this again , unless we are in the same situation , and in that case , I would probably still pay for better ."
It served its purpose
"Not the worst hotel , but could be way better ."
Our bathroom ...
"We were late in booking on a holiday weekend , so we booked what was available ."
Everything was excellent

Mom
So wonderful to have a historic Inn in our area !
Check in and out was pretty easy .
Clean and Spacious
The bathroom space was pretty big because it was also geared for a handicapped person .
The bed and pilllows were pretty ...
The shower head was on a slide bar so you can adjust it up and down .
The vanity part of the bathroom was pretty spacious to put all of your toiletries on .
I would go back in a heartbeat !
It was right in the middle of the bed room ... too funny !
Most beautifull view
"The beds where fine , the staff was great but the view from the top deck during breakfast .... breathtaking !!!!"
We got a free upgrade to a room with a jacuzi .
Amazing Front Desk Agent
She helped me take my luggage upstairs without any hesitation .
She later called my room to make sure everything was acceptable to my needs and then she was back in the morning to help me all over again ..
The kind of ...
When I arrived at the hotel the service I received from Shannon at the front desk was absolutely amazing ..
"Comfy room, good breakfast and helpful staff"
"Due to a computer glitch with the booking agent , the staff could not find our booking in the hotel 's system ."
Location is just across the trailhead of the courthouse butte .
"The breakfast was good : multi-grain bagels , waffle etc ."
The staff was quick to accommodate and gave us a room ( upgrade with no charge ) .
We can park at the hotel and ...
"Bugs, Bad Service, and Bad Price."
For our 75.68
"Hotel room for one night we walked into the room and my girlfriend walked into the bathroom and the toilet was not working properly , then she went to turn on the bath and bugs were crawling around in it ."
When we asked for our money back to switch to a different hotel the clerk refused and we ...
"Great hotel, AMAZING service!"
I recently stayed at the Hampton Inn Suites in Dodge City on my way to and from a training in KS .
"It was during a heat wave , and the bottle of water he offered was much appreciated ...."
"When I checked in on Sunday night , Paul greeted me and made sure I had a quiet room on the top floor ."
A bit road weary we up scaled to the Hampton from the rural stops we had been making .
"Kansas being one of the last remaining states for us to visit all 50 , we decided on Dodge City as a stop ."
Staff was very good and helpful and one of the previous reviewers had a great suggestion of a protected walkway ...
Very comfortable and good location
but the food was very good and the rooms were clean as well as roomy .
Dodge City Hampton Inn Suites
My only complaint is that they switched out the biscuit and gravy for French toast sticks .
The Dodge City Hampton Inn and Suites was a pleasant and comfortable stay .
Great Hotel
"The rooms are modern and reasonably priced , the Internet is fast and free for Hilton Honors members ."
The staff are very friendly and willing to assist you with whatever need you may have .
"There is a casino right next door , I do n't really gamble so I ca n't review it ."
Lots of warm smiles and willingness to make you feel at home .
Special thank you to Analy and Omar Andrade for responding to my requests .
"Very helpful and friendly staff , always taking care of my needs ."
Would give a solid 10 if it were not because of doors noise from adjacent rooms.

Great Stay
Housekeeping did a great job as well .
"Marilynn , who serves the free breakfast , was very nice and welcoming ."
Sold our house and could n't move into new house for several weeks .
Spent a week at this hotel .
The staff was VERY accommodating .
"Perfect Getaway, Everything We Needed"
Started each day with a brisk long walk in the fresh air ...
This was perfect .
Way better than a typical hotel .
We had a 3 - day business planning retreat here .
We rented the entire bed and breakfast .
"We wanted an environment different from the average , away from the day - to - day , where we could unplug , unwind and connect fully with what is important ."
"Add to that , the fact that the furnishings , while adequate , are ..."
"Cozy, great views, but overpriced, cabins need some updating, and inflexible (unfair) policies"
"I have now stayed here for 3 seasons - 2013 , 2014 and 2015 ."
Not sure I will return next time .
"The front desk staff have ALWAYS been terrific and helpful , friendly , but the owners ' strict adherence to some polices that are not really reasonable given choices provided elsewhere are at issue ."
Cabin Getaway
"Cabins are really neat , fully equipped , and the staff goes above and beyond expectations to make you feel comfortable ."
Had a blast at Arizona Mountain Inn.
"If you 're looking for that log -cabin experience , this is the place for you ."
Super vacation !
"Winter skiing , hiking , fishing , hunting , golfing .... all nearby ."
And the reading room was cute -- nice place to sit quietly .
Cozy Cabin
It did not feel crowded or squished .
It was more spacious than it looked on the website photographs .
"The cabins are neither fancy nor shabby , just good old - fashioned cabins with functional kitchenettes or full kitchens that are equipped with most of what ..."
We stayed for 6 nights in Cabin 5 .
It does n't cost much toast least get some new towels and bedspreads .
"Other than that , it was just great !"
This would have been a five star review except they really need to update the place .
We had a wonderful 1 night stay
We were traveling with our too large dogs and they were able to hang outside on the deck with us and hike in the forest ...
FREE wireless network! FREE HBO! FREE phone calls! FREE parking!
I came to know that this motel is newly renovated so I wanted to check it out .
I found that the room was clean and comfortable ( I stayed for 7 nights ) and the room included a microwave and fridge .
The rate was very reasonable .
They had smoking and non smoking rooms which I was pleased with since other motels near ...
Best Hotel in Cherokee
But their greatest asset is the woman checking you in .
I 'm so glad I found this place .
"I 've stayed at several hotels in the area , but this is favorite ."
I wish I could remember her name .
"It is clean , spacious , comfy , and close to th casino ."
Note : website was showing sold out but we ...
Super nice and friendly and helpful .
"Cereal , packaged muffins , juice etc ."
Return trip home
"Room was clean , wifi slow , bed cheap , breakfast adequate continental plus a waffle maker ."
Staff friendly - Cherokee reservation
Stopped on way home from Hilton Head - location directly across from casino .
First time staying at this location .
I had wonderful treatments at the spa across the street .
Loved the pool area and hot tub and location of ice machine .
Pleased
The fresh fruit water everyday in the lobby was great .
We definitely would stay again .
We stayed here as a weekend get away .
"Again , thank you for your feedback ."
Breakfast on his recommendation was great !
Clean comfortable hotel .
Dennis the shuttle driver provided a tour into Newport and back to the hotel that was better than paid tours in Boston and Manhattan we have been on .
Excellent Stay Dennis was the best!!
He is a tremendous asset to our team .
He was the highlight of our trip .
I will be certain to share your accolades with Dennis who will be thrilled to receive them .
Someone needs to recognize Dennis for his efforts !!
Thank you for taking the time to share your experience at our hotel with the TripAdvisor community .
The cleanliness and security is the most important feature to us .
The free breakfast at Hampton is not why we stay there .
"We appreciate your kind words and compliments regarding the cleanliness , comfort and security of our location ."
We are frequent visitors to Newport but never knew the history .
We learned the different neighborhoods and restaurant choices other than harbor side .
We look forward to having you as our guests again upon your return to Newport .
We will be back because of this A1 service .
He was also helpful with neighborhood information .
Pleasant Stay
The stay was highly satisfactory .
There seemed to be some confusion about the category of room ( we were allotted a room meant for handicapped person ) but Dan straightened it out within a minute .
"We were very impressed with Dan , who was managing the desk ."
Will stay there if we visit Newport again .
Breakfast was acceptable - fairly standard for this type of hotel .
"Clean, Efficient Hotel - Falls Short in Some Areas"
Common areas and rooms are well maintained .
Had issues with the Internet connection speed .
Hotel check - in and check - out is efficient .
Room 's window heat / air unit was a bit noisy for me - but I 'm a light sleeper .
Staff was inconsistent in terms of friendliness .
"Although the hotel is not in Newport , it is a straight drive right into the town ."
I loved the fresh fruit that was in the lobby at all times and the cookies in the evening .
Our room was very clean .
The hotel staff was incredibly friendly .
The included breakfast was different each day and it was quite tasty for a hotel breakfast .
The only thing I would recommend is that they scrub the hot tub .
They had coffee and tea available in the lobby throughout the day and the night .
We would definitely come back
Delighted
"I 've come to expect an excellent level of comfort at Hilton brand hotels , and this Hampton Inn did not disappoint !"
"Spotlessly clean , with friendly staff , free breakfast and comfortable rooms ."
"This hotel also has a shuttle service to downtown Newport , which is very convenient , since parking is at a premium during the summer season ."
Best buy for the .
Economical Jewel
It has great views of the mountains and is in the heart of Frisco .
Right in the middle of Frisco .
Rooms are old but are extremely clean .
"Simple , in the middle of Main Street and clean ."
This was my best stay at any economical hotel ever .
Very nice management .
"It gets hot in the room on warmer days , and of ..."
"That said , the hotel is older -- as in , you get an actual key to your room ."
"The room was spacious enough , beds were okay , and it had a refrigerator , microwave and coffeemaker , and a complimentary breakfast ."
"Yeah that old - the rooms have no air conditioning , just a window fan ."
You get what you pay for
"Older style motel split up into 2 or 3 single story buildings , all with exterior , park at your door entry ."
Surrounding grassy areas were nice and the property overall seems to be in great condition .
The room was just fine - perfectly ...
They take the Best Value name seriously
"This arrangement looked odd to me at first but , actually made the whole property feel uncrowded and relaxed ."
Best in Winfield!
from the college very near downtown Winfield .
Inn has a retro feel to it as you pull in it is one story tall and you park your vehicle right outside the door of your room .
Owner showed us three rooms and we would have ...
Stayed here while visiting our Southwestern College student the inn is less than 5 mins.
"Horrible! If traveling here for the Dover races, save your and go somewhere else!"
"I stayed here 2 weekends ago , as I was traveling to the Dover Nascar races ."
The hotel cost 500 per night due to the races !
"When we arrived in the room , it was regular motel style ... the tv had cigarrette burns in it ... the room reaked of smoke ( and I say this even though I am a smoker ) ... and the bathroom looked like ..."
Great Hotel
It make for a great place to hold family get togthers or just for a weekend get away .
The rooms could stand to be a little updated but the luxury suites are above and beyond .
The staff is very friendly and helpful and makes repeat guests feel like they are coming home .
This hotel has great dinner and breakfast package highly appreciated throughout the region .
"As a long time Tempurpedic mattress user , ..."
Decent Hotel for a Night
Good thing we had access to the king .
"It 's neat , clean , and seems to have the amenities one would expect for the price ."
The Colonial Hotel is a really decent place .
The king comes with a fridge and microwave while the queen has neither .
We booked both a king and double queen room .
"Attached is one of the best diners I 've ever eaten at , complete with an old - fashioned ice cream fountain that took me back to my youth ."
best diner

The motel staff were nice and helpful when possible .

"We were toward the back so had a bit of a walk to the front desk and adjoining restaurant , but that was okay ."
Easy drive to chain restaurants and Target .
Gorgeous Property!
I decided to stay here to have a quick and easy drive to the airport in the morning .
I wish all properties were like this one !
My jaw literally dropped when I went to check out the exercise room !
This property is brand new and fabulous .
"After driving 14 hours , starting out in 60 mph + winds , finding out interstate was closed due to a rock slide it was time to stop ."
Front desk staff greeted us with a smile and said they had a room ready .
MUST STAY
Told us we where in time for the chefs dinner and we ...
We had just called about a hour before .
"2 . Had everything we needed , even a little kitchenette ."
It 's small ( I think 5 rooms ) and walkable to anywhere in Hilo .
It got maybe a bit noisy with the street but ...
"Rooms are convenient and comfortable , with self check - in and number - pad doors that miraculously work ."
"This is a good one , guys !"
We stayed in the smallest ( read : cheapest ) room no .
What a fantastic find
"Close to everything, Clean, Business Hotel Feel"
I agree with other reviews that this might not be the hotel for you if you are looking for a fun / romantic getaway .
No extras -...
"Rooms were decent sized , clean , comfortable and had great views ."
The hotel is attractive but overall feels like a business hotel .
We spent the weekend after New Years at the Westin and enjoyed our stay .
Great service!!
If I 'm in the gas lamp area again I will definitely just go in and have a drink if Pebbles is working !!
Location is amazing !

Staff is amazing .
Stayed at the Westin for 2 nights .
Very knowledgeable and friendly !
Excellent .
"Gracious clear staff , perfectly cleaned and maintained ."
"Immaculate, excellent service, well appointed"
"It is noteworthy that there is a fee for internet , but the fee was waved for me ."
Spa and exercise options are very good .
The free shuttle from the airport is great .
For a weekend getaway this was a bit of a let down .
"Good for business, not so much of a getaway"
"I would recommend for a business traveler which it seemed geared toward , but for a fun couples weekend in the gas lamp it did n't provide any of the boutiquey extras I 've come to expect ."
"The bathroom in particular , the tub was ..."
The room was small and very generic .
I ca n't say one negative thing about this hotel .
My room was 437 and was very quiet and had a nice view over the front entry area and up the road - I ...
What a great stay in the gaslamp
When I arrived the bellhops greeted me and showed me inside where I was greeted by a friendly employee and checked in in less than 5 minutes .
"I really like this hotel -- friendly , inviting staff upon arrival , vibrant lobby and bar , and large clean rooms ."
"It is also a short run or walk to the waterfront ( about 0.6 miles ) and lots of new fitness , shopping , dining , and beautiful pier - side panoramas await those ..."
It is close to the airport and within walking distance of many fine dining opportunities .
My Second Time Here -- Excellent Choice for the Business Traveller

I do n't know what else to right this is making me right a whole story what can I honestly say that 200 characters this is annoying .
Loved the stay staff was friendly pool was nice coffee was great !
The room was clean and bed extemely comfortable .

Best nights sleep!
Beyond that I would have easily given this hotel a perfect 5 star rating .
"It is quiet , beds are so comfortable , front desk is amazing !"

The location is walking distance to really great food and ...

Lives up to the reputation of the brand .
Good for easy access to Universal theme parks
The Good : - The water ...
We stayed at the Loews Portofino Bay because of the proximity to the Universal theme parks and added benefits of express passes and early park admission .
We were there for 3 nights and then were booked at another hotel for the remaining nights of our holiday ( which did n't end up happening due to Hurricane Matthew ) .
Although more expensive ...
Every employee that we cam in contact with seemed friendly and they were all very helpful .
"Great choice , a beautiful hotel with a lot of guests but it never felt crowded ."
Great Experience
The pools were nice and the area was always clean .
We loved using the water taxi to go to city walk and come back to the hotel .
I was impressed with all of that the hotel and its staff did to insure its guests had a great time .

"We were treated to a free glass of bubbly upon arrival , which made a very good first impression ."
"I visited the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress with my family for spring break during the week of March 29 , 2015 ."
I was able to book a hotel and airfare deal with JetBlue a week prior to arriving .

"Slow service, not worth waiting for"
"The resort section is nice for older kids , but not much there for my toddler ."
Very disappointed with everything :
We did not get into our room until well over an hour past check in - and they have a late check in time !
We waited for everything and it was never worth it .
It had everything for a relaxing weekend that a couple would want .
Relaxing Resort
"We had some awesome meals at all the restaurants on property , enjoyed the fitness center and the Marilyn Monroe SPA , what else can a couple ask for ."
We were so impressed with the entire environment of this awesome resort .

"The hotel is immaculate , the rooms are amazing and the beds are very comfortable ."
The Press hotel was perfect right from the checkin .
24 Hrs in Portland
Found The Press Hotel when searching Trip Advisor and we were thankful .
"Lucky us , The Press was the solution ."
The one night weekend rate was way under the rack rate - considerably .
"The service was top notch from the valet , bellman , and ..."
We were looking for a property centrally located with amenities .
What a nice surprise finding this architectural gem .
Absolutely perfect location for walking around Portland .
"Hip , but not too hip ."
"Perfect location, friendly staff"
Really excellent little boutique - feeling hotel .
Restaurant solid and bar good too .
"Rooms nicely appointed , if a touch small ( few drawers for clothes ) big bathrooms ."
Staff super friendly and knowledgeable .
It 's been a year since I was there and reviewed the place .
Just one year later - just wanted to add
"Like a main console to not only control your room temp , drapes , lights , etc but you could also order food !"
Room service or take away .
Since then they added some things in the room .
The latter is food from FB outlets in the hotel and you self collect ...
"Beautiful rooms , great restaurants and pool ."
Best Resort So Far
"Not too big , not too small ."
Really enjoyed Aria Resort and Casino .
Staff is excellent .
The Aria Cafe has the best burgers and loaded tater tots I 've ever had .
Would recommend this venue to my friends and family .
Beautiful hotel
"Check in / check out was fast , in spite of a moderate long lineup ."
This was our second stay at ARia .
"Unfortunately , we were only able to see a little part of the strip , but who could argue , a strip view it was ."
We ...
We booked during a promotion which was going to give us an upgrade to a strip view .
A HEARTY VACATION
Amenities at Aria the best .
"Carbone was delish , a bit overpriced ."
Great food and drink .
Life was exciting after dark in the casino .
Loved the atmosphere .
The Aria was great .
Will be coming back real soon
4th stay at Aria .
Best Las Vegas Hotel
"Food , cleanliness , hotel staff , atmosphere can not be beat ."
It never disappoints .
My next stay in Vegas will be my 5th stay at Aria .
Try the Bardot Restaurant for wonderful French cuisine .
Bouncer was extremely rude to my friend who had sunglasses on and accused her of being drunk and barely let her into the club even though she did n't have anything to drink the whole day .
Do not go to Liquid pool club
Eventually we got in and paid cover but the pool closed 2 hours early .
Me and my 3 girlfriends went here .
We still had an ...
And do n't forget the smell when you enter the lobby -- I 'm pretty convinced that 's what Heaven smells like !
Best hotel on the Strip!
We came for a weekend getaway with friends and our third time at the Aria .
"We have tried other properties and just feel the Aria is the best -- perfect location , incredible restaurants , wonderful pool and fitness areas ..."
"Beautiful hotel but very, very busy"
Everything you would expect from a five star hotel .
"I know it 's Las Vegas but Aria has many , many rooms ..."
The comfort of our room was wonderful and we enjoyed our stay completely .
The only negative was that it was so overcrowded everywhere ...
"We had a beautiful suite in the tower with private check in , entrance and limo pick up ."
Great New Hotel
I stayed here for a weekend with friends .
It is attached to a mall with high - end shopping and very central .
The hotel is new and part of the city center development along with the Vdara and Mandarin Oriental hotels .
The rooms are very nice although I thought ...
This is a great hotel that I rate as a solid 4 stars .
But do it right
Forgetting Las Vegas for a moment if you can avoid losing your retirement pay at the casino and just gamble for entertainment then I ...
I rarely if ever give a five star and I am not a fan of Vegas .
This place was exquisite and the perfect place for a romantic getaway .
You never have to leave the hotel area .
I suggest you just leave the control in the auto position because the room will do all the start ...
Temperature just right and clean as a whistle and fully atuomated .
The room was perfect .
Up Scale and not as busy as other strip hotels
We had a standard room with a minor view of the strip .
When we opened our door the room lit up and the drapes opened automatically .
"Best of all , the beds are insanely comfy !!"
The best in Vegas!
The best stay we 've had in all the times we 've been to Vegas .
"The rooms are luxurious , the staff are very accommodating , and the casino is not overly crowded ."
We will always stay here from now on .
Everything is pricey here but that 's to be expected from the strip !
"Great view, location and room"
Rooms are lovely with a tablet to control all functions .
We stayed for 3 nights and had a room with a great view of the strip on the 25th floor .
"Beds were comfy , I would n't pay more for a strip view unless that 's important for you - we had a gorgeous mountain view to enjoy which was a nice break from the strip ."
I went to Vegas with a girlfriend and we stayed in a standard room with 2 queen beds .
One of the cleanest hotels in Vegas.....
We walked through most of the hotels and casinos ...
Ex .
Return to Paradise!
"Stunning service with kindness , support and upgrades when any question came up ."
This resort is worth every one of its five diamonds !
"When I called the operator to find out the opening time of Jean Phillipe , she said , they opened 30 minutes ago , Mr. G - -- , they are waiting for you ... -- absolute magic ."
Loved this place!
Pools were gorgeous but found the restaurants were a little overpriced for me .
Staff were exceptionally friendly throughout the resort and the room was beautiful and very comfortable - felt like I was in a 5 star resort .
And I also did the TV check out .
And the bed was comfy .
Fabulous High Tech Hotel
Great location and facility .
I also enjoyed the casino. and the slot machines .
I did the mobile check in which was fast and easy .
I loved the high tech rooms .
Which was just as easy .
Will stay again .
Had a blast next time will bring wife and kids lots to do here and really felt welcomed also enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff are very helpful and friendly .
My getatay
Sure to recommend Aria to all my friends and family .
Another perfect trip
It is a special place .. great for the modern crowd but not extremely trendy ...
The staff seems to care .
We pick the Aria for laid back location and the modern feel .
Yes we lost all our gambling funds but the atmosphere and vibe was worth it .
Aria NOT
"Going to my room notice the walls are so beat up , huge knicks on the walls , carpets smell musty ."
"Room good size , the bed was not comfortable - too lumpy , nice size bathroom but CAUTION the marble used on the shower floor ..."
"Upon entering the cigarette smoke hits you , been to hotels in Vegas and the smell here was strong ."
"Hotel appearance is modern , very clean and stylish ."
It looks very upscale and was a bargain for what we paid per night ( mid week ) .
"It s large and as such , was a loooonnggg walk to get out of the hotel there is a lot of winding through the Crystal shops and then a plunge outside and then back into the lobby ...."
Jazzy super-large hotel
Best value for nicest room
I did not have a change to try out the restaurants ...
"Originally I was a little concerned about the distance from the hotel to the strip , but it s not near as bad as it looks on a map ."
Stayed at the Aria on a business trip .
The casino is great and the location in respect to other hotels is perfect .
"Being empty nest 'rs , we tend to look for more elegant adult atmospheres and of course want our money to go a long way ..."
Fabulous... This TEXAN (not the football team) was extremely pleased!
I am very particular in my lodging choices and the Aria did not disappoint !
I requested a high floor with a really nice view and was happily accommodated .
This hotel is ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS and it has everything ...
I highly recommend the Aria .
"State of the Art , Beautiful , luxury , high energy hotel ."
Stay at the Aria - Incredible
"The restaurants are impeccable and have such a wide cultural variety , the atmosphere is amazing , the staff is incredibly helpful and friendly , and the rooms are unbelievably clean , state of the art , and high tech - so comfortable ."
You will be having the time of your ...
As soon as you walk in the room the drapes open up .
Beds are also comfortable .
I like that they have an air conditioned room to sit at while you wait for your car ....
Pretty cool .
Room is comfy and plenty of room .
Second time at this nice and modern hotel .
Second visit
You can walk to the high end mall Crystals .
Ample shopping area and great restaurants .
Attractive Hotel In Las Vegas
"It was memorable stay in Aria Resort , very good valet service and friendly staff at the reception ."
Rooms are big size and all the controls are at our finger .
This city center hotels and resort is very attractive structure and good value for money and much more .
Amazing Hotel and Casino
Beautiful casino and restaurant and shopping district .
I love this hotel and will be back many times in the future .
"The staff is friendly , the food is t too pricy and the location is perfect ."
Vegas always seems to offer a 5 star experience for much less than other cities .
Check - in was a only 10 minutes when we arrived Thursday around 7 pm ( although I did notice longer lines at other times during our stay ) .
Fantastic Las Vegas experience
Our only room complaint was that ...
"Our room was great with a strip view - spacious , super comfy bed , lovely shower / bath area and lots of wardrobe / drawer space ."
We stayed for 4 nights with 6 others couples .
Consistently bad service that left us hungry for some decent hospitality
The line moved at an excruciatingly slow pace ...
We arrived at around 11:30 pm and were surprised to find a long winding line at the check in area .
We had high hopes for the Aria - during our Christmas mini-getaway we chose it over several competing hotels due to its promise of a newer hotel with great service and amenities .
Beautiful hotel !
Food offered ( and the staff that ...
"Great service, techno-savvy room"
I felt safe in my room Aria associates were stationed outside of elevators to make sure only guests were permitted on the hotel area .
"In addition to the rooms , the conference center was comfortable and attractive ."
"Room was perfect , with several bonuses such as press-button controls of the blinds , lights , and TV ."
Great location and nice hotel
I 'd say that Aria is the most modern and sleek hotel .
"I 've been to Vegas about 8 times and I 've stayed in a variety of hotels , from the Venetian , Paris , Bellagio , Bally 's , Wynn , Caesar 's Palace , Hilton , etc ."
"Maybe because it 's one of the newer ones , but I will admit I like their ambiance ."
"The location is great , it 's right by ..."
second visit amazing
"This suite was fabulous with lounge , entry hall separate bedroom and massive bathroom , the comfort and attention to detail superb and we found ourselves relaxing in here and hiding from the heat outside ."
This was our second visit to the Aria we were allocated a Tower Suite on the 22nd floor .
You are also allocated the Tower Lounge with separate ...
High Quality Hotel and Staff
It has been a long time since we had been to Las Vegas and quite a lot has changed in that time .
It used to be a place where accommodation ...
We stayed at the Aria for a couple of nights in July 2016 as a starting point for our family road trip and found it to be an excellent hotel .
Great but not as great as the first time
I ...
It has wonderful high ceilings unlike some other casinos so you never feel closed in .
It truly is a fantastic place to stay while in Vegas even now .
The casino and resort feels very upscale and some how though its packed it never feels crowded .
The pool is also fantastic .
This is my second time staying at the Aria .
Great place to stay if you want to avoid a lot of children .
Hands Down One of the Best Hotels in Vegas
Loved all of the extra amenities ...
My husband and I love this hotel .
Not a lot of horrible traffic through the resort like you have at some of the other hotels .
This is our second time to stay at the Aria .
Very laid back and very elegant .
AMAZING!!!! OMG! The BEDS and PILLOWS
I have never in my life slept in a bed so comfortable AND the pillows .
I traveled to Vegas the week of June 28 - July 1 with my husband on business and we stayed at the ARIA .

The room was amazing and the bed beyond comfortable .
"There casino area was also great , there was live music at the bar and a great atmosphere ."
We ordered room service for breakfast one morning and the food was delicious .
Location is excellent .
Nice hotel but very expensive for food drink
"Stay is pleasant however , very expensive and staff no more helpful than in other hotels ."
Then other members of group arrived and they were upgraded !
"Typical , no luck !"
"We are here for a special occasion , on Checkin hotel asked this - we were hoping for upgrade or something , but nothing !"
I highly recommend The Aria
I would definitely stay at the Aria again .
The Aria needs to hire more more Check - in staff from 5 PM - 7 PM .
"We had to wait at least 15 minutes to check - in , I felt like I was at an Airport Ticket Counter"
ARIA IS 1
I recently attended a conference held at ARIA Las Vegas .
"The ARIA buffet has so many international food options , I felt I was dining ..."
"The conference accommodations were fantastic ( room temperature was a bit too cold at times ) however , I fell in love with this hotel ."
This was my first trip to Vegas but it definitely wo n't be my last !

"Great cleaning staff , front desk , room service ."
Grilled chicken sandwich was the best ever .
"Mini bar prices are not too bad , fiji water was more expensive than liquor ."
Nice standing shower with jacuzzi .
Complementary pick - up drop - off at Airport makes a huge difference to the overall experience .
"Meant to book Sky Suites due to great previous experience , mistakenly booked Tower Suites ."
"Separate check - in and lounge does away with long wait at check - in , lounge also offers snacks light breakfast ."
"So far , comparable to Sky Suites but not quite so up - scale ."
Suite itself was ...

Elevators were quick and efficient l.
EVERYTHING !
Exceeds Expectations
IT IS AWESOME !
"Room service is twice daily , plus turn down service with chocolates , motivational quotes and slippers ."
The entire property is immaculate .
The pictures do this place no justice .
You have to try the turkey burger and lemonade at the burger shack .
You wo n't ...
It can be a bit tricky to get sunbeams though - and too many are reserved for VIPs and ...
Lots to like........
The day club is tantalising ( I 'm too old ) but not so noisy that it spoils the pool vibe for non-clubbers .
The pool area is good - plenty of sun ( as opposed to too much shade at some other Strip 5 stars ) .
Anniversary Bliss
Once again they surpassed our expectations !!
The room was so comfortable that it made it hard to want to leave to do anything else .
There are so ...
This was our second visit to this hotel .
We spent five nights at the Aria for our 1st anniversary .
We were put into a corner suite on the 18th floor with amazing views .
6 friends on a very short break completely blown over by The Aria .
Everything very efficient from start to finish during our stay .
Location perfect .
lovely stay with friends
Rooms huge and spotless with fantastic views - only downside was the pillows - too soft for my liking .
"The lobby areas very clean , casino not ..."
We asked for rooms near to each other and this request was easily met .
Aria is excelent on al counts for a Las Vegas stay .
"Considering its size , it does provide high quality in all respects ."
I have had excellent experiences at this hotel and our last stay was no exception .
It has excellent facilities and service is great in all areas of the hotel .

Overall the Hotel is fantastic .
The room was great we had a corner suite with a pano view .
The staff were great and the restaurants were amazing .
Very easy to navigate throughout the hotel as many casinos are very confusing .
Amazing
From the staff to the food at the buffet and the cafe to the night life .
One of the best stays I 've had in Vegas !!
Traveled there a few weeks back for my 35th birthday and my stay at Aria was nothing short of AMAZING !
Will definitely stay there again .
Check in went smooth and the view of the strip and mountains was nice BUT although the room was large the dark brown walls and decor was reminiscent of a boardroom .
"I initially noticed that the night tables were not dusted upon checking in , but did n't give much notice as we were very ..."
Now on to the issue of housekeeping ....
What housekeeping
Best hotel I've visited so far.....all premium amenities and service
Between ...
I 've been to Vegas 4 times now and used to stay at Cesar 's but this place does n't compare with anything else in Vegas .
"I travel at least once per year and as far as all the hotels I 've been to , this has been the best by far ."
"The food , service and room was probably the best that I 've experienced ."
Great stay for our honeymoon
The Aria is a stunning hotel that is in a great location near the Strip .

I 'm sure this is modern high end Vegas at it s very best .
"Stylish, modern and slick"
The hotel room had the latest in modern technology all easily controlled by a tablet .
The range and quality of the many restaurants was astounding .
We loved the high end Mexican restaurant and the breakfast buffet ... which offered a vast choice !

We loved our stay here .
A Good Night
Aria looked new and fresh and the package deal with airfare was pretty compelling .
I was in Las Vegas on a quick business trip recently and really did n't have any idea where to stay .
The room was clean enough to eat off the floor ( although I chose not to ) ....
The room was large with a stunning view and huge windows .
Aria is the Ultimate experience
"From the second you Valet your car , to check - in , service is phenomenal ."
Highly recommend this luxury hotel .
Never have we been disappointed .
We stay here most times when visiting Las Vegas .
We stayed in a corner suite facing the strip with 3 TVs and 2 bathrooms ... ca n't get much nicer then that !
Food options were from high end to easy to buy .

Great Value

Stayed at the Aria for 3 nights March 5 - 8
The comps are n't what they used to be .
We booked our comp suite after analyzing our offers .
We turned down 400 more dollars to experience the Corner suite at the Aria ... surprise !!!
When we arrived they down graded our suite .. so read the fine print !!!
Awesome !
Never seen anything like it .
The Aria was by far one of the best places that I have stayed in Vegas .
The curtains open the TV comes on and plays music .

Outstanding service at the Aria
The entire property was spotless and had a good vibe .
A good and new(ish) resort hotel but overloaded
"Aria is part of an integrated development with Mandarin Oriental as high end hotel , Aria hotel and casino complex and Crystals shopping mall ( Prada , Vuitton etc ) - a little bit dead except as a walkway to ..."
Bellagio and Caesar 's Palace are close .
Location : at the south end of Las Vegas Bvld .

Ca n't wait to book our next Vegas trip there .
"During our recent stay at the Aria , my fianc and I experienced nothing but exceptional service ."

The Best
The M club was fun as well racking up our points .
They have a Javier 's in this hotel .
This facility is a gem .
"Trendy , fun and the staff is amazing ."
You literally do not need to leave this resort .
"Bedspreads on this visit had questionable stains on them , not freshly replace for our visit ."
"Black mold in the shower area , gross !"
Hotel Needs A Little Help
"It 's a lovely hotel , but like every hotel in Las Vegas it 's highly used ."
"One of the three pools has changed , they charge 100.00 for lounge chairs ..."
We 've been coming to the Aria Hotel since its grand opening .
Cleanliness was a priority .

The beds were so comfortable we did nt miss our own bed at home like we usually do .
The check in was quick and we had a room on the 42 floor .
The rooms were very clean and had eveything you could need .
We arrived at the hotel and experienced the wonderful front desk staff .
I arrived Saturday around 4:00 pm I was a bit nervous because I had read that check - in can be a pain .
I was ushered to the an available agent as soon as I walked through the door was given a room quickly and was told there would be a 32 - 34 resort fee ( cant remember exact amount ) plus a hold charge ...
Relaxing and Fun Time!
Dealers were friendly in the casino and staff at ...
I did n't find the convention area to be as much of a trek as in other Vegas hotels .
Luxury for Work Travel
"Rooms were spacious , upgraded for 30 / night to get a strip view on the 31st floor ."
Stayed four nights with hubby for a work conference .
We appreciated the security posted near the guest elevators .
Can't wait to go back!! Perfect location!
From check - in to check - out our stay was amazing .
Highlights from the trip were the pool ( a host easily found us front row chairs during ...
"Knowing little about the property , we booked based on the reviews and location ."
My husband took me to Las Vegas for my 30th birthday .
We planned a trip through Expedia and bundled Aria into our package .
"However , be prepared for staff not carrying out their duties properly , excessive queues at check - in and check - out , and long walks across the casino to get from the elevators to the front door ."
Lacks true value for money
Not 5 Star Lacks Value for Money
"Stayed here twice now , and there 's no doubting this is a fancy hotel inside and out ."
Then there 's another long walk before you ...
"A little on the pricy side but in my opinion worth it ,"
Outstanding
Very clean and spacious rooms weather a suite or just standard deluxe room .
"We just loved the Aria , everything from the Tower Suites check in to the music selection playing throughout the resort was just amazing ."
"As a frequent guest at the Aria , our most recent trip was almost as expected ."
Great Resort but showing some signs of corporate bean counting.
"However , we have began to notice a small degradation of the quality of ..."
The modern decor and high end furnishings definitely make the Aria stand out from other resorts .
The property in general is outstanding for it 's facilities and its location on the strip .
Excellent Choice for Relaxation
"If you want to sleep on a cloud while in Vegas , ARIA is THE place ..."
The in room controls and excellent dining are only the tip of the iceberg for this fantastic hotel !
The shower in my room was heavenly and everything was spotless .
"The staff throughout , and in the spa , were superb and seemed to genuinely enjoy their job ."
ARIA has given me the opportunity to do so .
Check in and the numbering system in the hallways .
Ha!
I 've always wanted to use that song title for a review .
Luxury: Cococure
"Now , there were only two issues with my ARIA stay ."
"The hotel receptionist had a hard time divvying up our check in , understanding that several nights were to be paid ..."

The beds and pillows are fabulous .
They have the best restaurants too .
Beautiful hotel !
I also love how everything in the room can be controlled by one device !
I like the separate living space and bedroom .
"Overall , it can be pricey , but it 's worth it !"
The corner suite is very tech savy and modern !
The monorail also stops here which is a plus !
Very nice!
As compared to several other Casinos on the strip the Aria casino had the least offensive smell of cigarettes .
The buffet was good but pricey .
"The concierge was helpful , long line but they placed staff in line to speed up process ...."
The hotel was very nice .
We went early in the morning would recommend for lunch or supper not breakfast .
Weekend getaway
Everything you want in a 5 star resort .

My husband and I always love to stay here and we come minimum 3 times a year but the last 2 stays of ours were very unsatisfactory and all due to unprofessional staff at Mlife .

"Fantastic services , a huge selection of top quality restaurants at all price points and a large and comfortable casino ."

DONT STAY IN THE ARIA!!
"ever , would n't stay here again ."
"I do NOT recommend this hotel to anyone , on check in they explained to us we need to leave a holding fee of which will be refunded on check out if we were not to use anything ( of which we did n't ) ."
I left this holding fee then only on check ...

Good location
"It is in between Bellagio and Monte Carlo , so we can take the free tram that runs between those 2 hotels ."
Location is good .
Room is in good size .
The hotel is big and it is a trendy one .
The hotel is one of the newer ones on the strip .
The mattress is abit too soft .
There is a coffee ...
"I decided to spend a little more ( which was n't a lot in comparison to other hotels for same type of room , maybe 20 / night ) for the newer hotel based on reviews and online pictures ..."
I spent a lot of time researching the hotels for my first trip to Las Vegas .
Must stay! Wish I didn't have to leave!
This hotel was amazing and I could n't stay anywhere else now !
The ...
"The room was large and very nice , with floor to ceiling windows which offered us a great view ."
The washroom had a separate WC and a large shower my only complaint would be the limited counter space ... but I should learn to travel with less toiletries !
We stayed at Aria for 7 nights in July and had a great time !
Wonderful Stay
Excellent Hotel
Otherwise the whole experience was exceptional .
Stayed for 4 days here .
The Amenities are awesome .
The beer was expensive here .
The only thing negative during my stay was that I lost money from gambling .
The staff were friendly .
Great Vibe
I like the push - button Privacy and ...
I really like the overall vibe of this property .
"It 's less central than the Bellagio , but we had a great room -- and the bathroom was especially nice ."
"Last time we stayed at the Bellagio , which I enjoyed , but we wanted to try something different and settled on Aria ."
This was my second trip to Vegas .
Fully built with the latest technology mmomento .
impeccable luggage service where you make your free baggage check in and go to your room where you deliver it to you at no additional cost !
Simply spectacular !
The best modern resort In Vegas!
"When you open the door of his room , the lights come on automatically , the TV starts up with music , the curtains open , all monitored by ..."
"Instead , we went to the mobile check - in line it literally took less than 5 minutes ."
Loved it!
"Luckily , we got an email was able to check - in 24 hours prior avoid the * LONG * line to check - in ."
The room itself was ...
We were on the 19th floor had a great king bed room with a view of the strip .
"Caution , do not use or open the fridge unless you are purchasing the items in it ."
Close to everything .
Javier 's restaurant was great .
Nice clean hotel .
Nice hotel
Pool was really nice but very crowded .
You are not allowed to use it for personal use .
4 pools to take your pick and a vibrant casino .
Bliss
Great service wonderful view from room and amazing facilities .
Highly recommended for a treat !
"Shops , restaurants and bars - all you need !!"
We stayed at the tower suites and it was heaven on earth !
Great Hotel
I really like that everything was controlled by the tablet in the room .
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the ARIA .
I will stay at the ARIA again when visiting Las Vegas .
The room was spacious and very comfortable .
"The service , the room and the conference area were great ."

"Always a great stay at the ARIA , love the rooms and dining options ."
ARIA 1/16
"Great location and shopping nearby ( high end , shopping ) Highly recommend Todd English PUB for drinking and Serrano for eating"
Tables get a little high on weekends but that happens .
"First , the poker tournament area is in the casino area rather than the poker room proper ."
I 've rated the Aria as excellent overall .
It seems to be between two discordant sources of music and in ...
"Since no place is perfect , these comments will address only the imperfections ."
"The property is great , and the poker room is the best in Vegas ."
Top Notch Property for Poker
A disgrace
"No sign for valet , just self parking ."
So you follow the sign to find yourself in a gigantic and full parking lot with ...
This is a case of another Vegas hotel that thinks that just because this is Vegas it can treat its patrons like cattle .
When you drive up to the hotel there is a sign to self parking .
Anniversary vacation
One night we ...
The room was mediocre but very dusty and I would n't have expected to see that .
We arrived at the hotel my husband and I .
We asked for an upgrade we were told you the hostile receptionist there were none which I found hard to believe .
We were charged resort tax but did n't use the pool or gym .
150 a day is ridiculous
And to top it off my room is n't ready .
IF YOU BOOK THERE BE PREPAIRED !
In addition to the 35 Resort Fee .
It only looks good on the outside .
Staying here is like having a pretty girl with an ugly attitude .
The management is terrible
YOU NEED AN EXTRA 150 A DAY .
except the bed was not that great that i was expecting .
nice place to stay!
spend my new year holiday in this hotel and we enjoyed .
"The hotel location , amenity and resturant ... was great but the bed was kind of old loking and soon soft the if i was staying more than 5 ays that we stay we could heve backach !!!"
2 sinks not too much counter space .
Automated switches and controls for everything .
Bathroom - had a stand up shower and a soaker tub beside it .
Bed was very nice and comfy .
Great Location-Nice Hotel
Only setback was the water closet had a frosted door and which defeated ...
Room decor was modern and comfortable .
Stayed at Aria for 3 nights in a King Bedroom .
Awesome Hotel
I had a fabulous stay .
I love the bathroom and the view was on the strip so it made it beautiful .
I would stay again .
The only thing I did n't like is that they did n't have a microwave .
We stayed in the Tower Suite and it was fabulous .
After several trips to Vegas each year for the last several years
as advertised
Classy place with great features .
The Aria remains one of my favorites .
Very centrally located so you can get to many shows and other casinos .
A very nice hotel
everybody who likes a nice style and high quality would be happy to stay here .
"I was skeptical about this hotel after experiencing Area coffee on the lobby level of this hotel , but have to say I am Positively surprised ."
"The room is contemporary designed , large enough and really well maintained ."
"Yes , I would expect complimentary water in room as ..."
Again was there for work .
second time at resort
The mobile checkin was screwed up and it was a 50/ 50 for the people in line when I ...
"The rooms are ultra sleek and modern , electronic shades and curtains , full A /V system ."
The WiFi in the room worked well .
What is great is the large bathroom with both a tub and shower and dual sinks .
"excellent service very courteous staff , concierge excellent service , bell boy very clean rooms the buffet is widely with many different stations of choices and good food the casino is very well located and winning is favorable"
vacation
Here 's a few observations .
My new favorite hotel on the strip
"Pool drinks : good , but ..."
"Pool was super , and had adequate seating in shade and sun ."
"Room was fantastic : stand - up shower , tablet that controls lights , drapes , and television ."
Very nice .
"We had an early flight in , and we were able to enjoy the pool by getting ' pre ' checked in , and texted us when the room was ready ."
"If you love luxury , impeccably clean rooms , stunning art , and eclectic eateries , than this place is for you ."
Luxury from Check-In
"The first time I went to Aria was related to an unfortunately loud guest staying next door to me at another MGM hotel , and I can tell you that the move was the best decision I ever made , because I got to ..."
Great Hotel!
Room was great we were at the back of the hotel ...
"Second time staying here , staff are always friendly at check in no free upgrade this year !"
They have started using a mobile check in so you do some of it before you get there and it also helps the line up at check in less of a wait time .
2 nights in the Aria were pure luxury .
"Obviously this is Vegas so everything else was expensive - the restaurants and parking etc , but as a treat it was perfect ."
The staff we met were polite ...
We had an interconnecting room with our teens and so lots of space for us to be tidy and them to make a mess !
Wonderful rooms with lots of space. Nice pools and a good choice of restaurants.
Check - in was easy with online check - in .
Great Location and Value
I had a great view of the strip from my room on the 35th floor .
I stayed in the hotel for 5 nights in April for business .
"Location is convenient to the strip , shopping , and restaurants ."
The lobby is beautiful .
The room is spacious and operates from an iPad beside the bed .
When I ...
Didn't Leave
Every single employee
I encountered was genuinely polite and gracious .
I had such a great experience at The Aria Oct . 17-20th that I did n't leave the property until it was time to Uber back to McCarran .
I was there for the canceled Stones show and Aria was buzzing with a great vibe .
Room 21228 was immaculate and housekeeping were on their game .
Some of the ...
Another pleasant stay at Aria .
Aria awesome as always.
Ask for a room on a high floor if you want a view .
Brick oven pizza was delicious and buffet filing .
Our rooms were on the 4th floor and all we could see was a/c equipment .
"From equipment not working , to being checked into an already occupied room , to maid service not being completed ."
"Good place, needs work"
I really do love staying at Aria !
"It 's very nice , centrally located on the strip , and the service is great , however the last three times I 've been there , there 's been one or more issues that I 've had to call about ."
The hotel ...
"In August of 2015 , we stayed at the Staybridge Suites as we prepared to celebrate the wedding of our son and his wife ."
We came in a few days ahead of the wedding party to help out her family with the details of the wedding .
"We reserved rooms for family , wedding party , and additional guests , having to change the reservations ..."
Wonderful Family Wedding
Excellent hotel
I was given a massive room with a kitchen which was well stocked .
Service was great and staff very friendly .
The hotel is also located in a good place in walking distance of plenty of restaurants and a Starbucks .
"This hotel is excellent , very clean inside out ."
Will use again
1st Time at a Staybridge - I'd Stay Again
Bob was a good host taking care of guests as they arrived and looking after others in the lounge .
Having tried 3 other hotels locally I wanted something nicer .
I ...
I arrived at 7 pm and received a warm welcome from Bob .
With drinks and a snack meal available I was able to relax without having to sit in another restaurant .
Very good stay with lots of energy .
Wedding Trip
Great party hotel for my bachelor party
Hotel is situated in a great place and all the amenities like the pool and bar were fantastic .
I booked a weekend stay at the W for my bachelor party .
"I booked the room weeks in advance , but the staff said that my room was unavailable due to maintenance ."
I pressed for the room I booked and eventually got the room I wanted .
"On top of that , they included drink tickets ."
The trip started a little rough but it was great .
Swanky hotel in the heart of Austin
The room was clean and the staff was pleasant .
The room was more than adequate .
This was a business trip and the stay was pleasant .
We love to stay at W Hotels when we travel .
"We were disappointed that there were NO drawers in the furniture in the room , so we had to improvise and stack things on the desk ."
We would definitely choose this location on our next Austin business trip .
For the price this is a well located hotel with spacious rooms with free coffee and breakfast .
Really ok.
The room was clean and quiet with no ...
"You 'll need a car in California so with that in mind this location is close to Victoria Gardens , Rancho Cucamonga 's premier shopping and dining destination and is about 15 minutes from Ontario Mills retail mall ."
"Also the A / C in my room did n't work well either , and it can not give me a comfortable temperature ."
"Given such a bad situation , they said they ..."
Most terrible hotel experience.
"The hotel I stayed is so - called a 3 - star hotel , here was no hot water in my room and I could n't take shower ."
"Then I asked for additional blankets , but they said all were gone ."
Beds were especially comfortable .
Breakfast was a little disappointing but varied enough that there was something for everyone
Comfort Quiet in Rancho
Very comfortable and plush accommodations at a reasonable price right off Foothills Blvd .
Best place ever!
"One of the best hotels I 've stayed in - staff is great , location is perfect , and accommodation 's / amenities A ++"
"There are restaurants within walking distance , all the stores you would ever need for necessities , but hotel / room is quiet and comfortable ."
"We plan on visiting this hotel again , even if just a weekend getaway ."
It was clean but old and in need of an upgrade .
"Perfect Location, Good Hotel"
"The Lincoln Park Zoo is 5 minutes walk away , there are multiple bars and restaurants in walking distance and even downtown ( Millenium Park ) is walkable ( about 2 hours walk if you walk slowly and look at all the other fun buildings around ) ."
The location of the hotel is great !
The only negative about the hotel would be bathroom .
The staff was super friendly and helpful .
We staid at this hotel for two nights .
We would stay here again if we come back to Chicago .
"After a very late night , we woke to a view of the Lincoln Park Zoo and Lake Michigan ."
"I ' crashed ' here after an event , so I had done no research like I would have for a getaway ."
"I had zero expectations when I checked in , and definitely found myself wishing we were staying a few more days ."
I loved it !
Only needed a bed but got an experience instead
"Our bed was n't as soft as I needed , but I got a decent night 's sleep ."
The decor was classic and a bit whimsical .
"The location was perfect , the room small but stylish , the bathroom classic and efficient ."
"We walked the neighborhood , enjoying the people , sights , scents , and vibe of Lincoln Park ."
Everything was great during our stay except that there was no hot water in the sink .
Great location and stay
Hotel Lincoln
I was lucky to be upgraded to a lovely Jr suite with great views of the lake and park .
"Unfortunately , I was only in town for 24 hours so I could n't fully enjoy the hotel ."
Hotel is ok .
Hotel Lincoln
If you are looking for a cool hipster venue ... this is it !
Rooms could be cleaner and smell better .
All staff genuinely seemed happy to work there and help guests .
From start to finish the staff was super helpful .
"Great Location, Amazing Staff"
The room was comfortable and spacious ( a corner room ) .
The vibe is great hip and fun without the pretentiousness of some hipster places .
And that is just one example of how excellent the staff was .
Best decision I made the whole trip .
I say that because I cancelled my second night stay from an awful hotel downtown and booked my second night at the Hotel Lincoln .
"I was super greatful and tried to give him a tip , he would n't take it ."
My wife had a bad stomach ache in the middle of the night and I called down to the front desk and asked if they had any Pepto - Bismol .
Next trip to Chicago I 'm staying here again !
Night and day above the other
"The room was great ( spacious , clean , well furnished and very modern ) and the staff was even better ."
They said no and started telling me where the nearest Walgreen 's was and then stopped and offered to get some money from me and go get it for me since it was the middle of the night .
"Also , the rooftop bar was great - although a bit pricey ."
"Our disappointment was in the room itself , which was extremely small and not at all comfortable - overall felt like it was way too much money for such an uncomfortable room ."
Room was disappointing
"We were disappointed in the room - however , I will say that if you 're looking for a small place with a great view and a really nice park directly across the street , this place is perfect ."
"Decent for the price , my room did n't have a microwave ."
Good stay
"I inquired about that at checkout , and was told to make sure to ask when I make my reservation ."
Overall good stay .
"This stay I was on the end of the building away from the railroad tracks , thus giving more restful sleep ."
Even when asked a several times .
"Horrible smelly roomsasked for our money back , since we could not have stayed in this place with my daughter having difficulties breathing in that smell ."
"PLEASE,AVOID THIS PLACE"
Rude staff .
"They told us they will refund - well , the money was never returned to my account ."
Consider this motel ...
Could not have been treated more poorly
"Counter staff tried to be helpful , however my problem needed the manager 's attention ."
"He was not on site , but could be reached by phone , but refused to talk with me ."
Refused to do that or talk with me about my concerns .
"The lobby smelled like smoke and I wanted to cancel my reservation. , which required his ok ."
Excellent cleanliness .
Felt safe coming and going .
Great entertainment is near by .
Great room .
Great service .
I 'd recommend this facility to all of my friends and relatives .
Satisfied
Wild Country night club .
All the front desk personnel were helpful and friendly .
"Food was OK , but nothing exciting ."
Nice Stay
"Our room was nice , clean and comfortable ."
The breakfast area is a bit disorganized and cramped .
The hotel is well located and convenient to get downtown or anywhere else .
We had ...
We have stayed here previously and can tell they have done a few updates .
I 'd highly recommend it !
I stayed in the Pontchartrain Suite so that my daughter her 9 bridesmaids could get ready .
It could not have been any better !
"It was spacious enough for everyone , plus the hair make - up crew , as well as friends stopping by ."
Wedding
The bellman went out of their way for us and we had no complaints .
Very nice hotel
"We experienced a clean room , very friendly and helpful staff , good food , and location ."
We would stay there again .
"While you can always look hard enough to find something wrong with a hotel , the Omni for our two nights there was excellent ."
Got in late to find the room lights and tv on !
I loved this hotel !
"It was great , I did n't have to drag my bags into a dark room and find the lights ."
"So , comfortable , great sleep and oh man great shower !!"
Total Relaxation
"A great , safe location near all of the action and within walking distance of many great restaurants ."
Great Place in the Quarter
Rooms were very clean and quiet .
The Omni Royal Orleans is a great place to stay in the French Quarter .
The Rib Room restaurant has a good menu and the food is very good .
"After a very long day travelling , 2 flights , 14 hrs total ."
"As this visit was for my friend 's Special Birthday , and mine , I was not impressed ."
As were 2 other members of staff .
Birthday celebrations start at the Omni Royal
"Especially , as I had contacted the Hotel ..."
"The receptionist was extremely rude , and not welcoming at all ."
"Transfer taxi , no show , finally arrived at the Omni Royal ."
Do not stay here
Our upgraded balcony room over looked the dumpster .
The hotel billed for Wi Fi service that was not used .
The housekeeping service was VERY POOR .
Towels were never replaced and we had to call for soap .
Centrally located and classic
"Centrally located with all the typical amenities youd look for in luxury lodging ( gym , pool , rooftop , in - room dining , restaurant / bar in the hotel room ) ."
"For my taste and money , I like ..."
This is an older hotel in the French Quarter .
"We did nt use the gym or the pool , but we did order room service and eat at the restaurant ( Rib Room ) ."
Also very relaxing is having a drink and enjoying the pianist in the afternoon .
Great food .
Great place to stay.
Hotel is beautiful and well - kept .
I enjoy the breakfast brunch .
Outstanding location .
Staff very friendly and helpful .
The pool and pool bar are rooftop and offer a panoramic view of the city and river .
Very relaxing .
Great Hotel
The location of the hotel is perfect and we were able to walk to places like Caf DuMonde and Bourbon Street .
There were several shops and restaurants within walking distance as well .
Very clean hotel with a very attentive and courteous staff .
I have also recommended it to friends and colleagues who were very pleased .
I have stayed many times at this hotel over the past 20 + years and prefer it to the others I have tried in New Orleans .
It is somewhat pricey but you will not be disappointed .
Well worth the cost!
Good Experience- TINY Rooms
"Loved the location , service and staff ."
"The hotel is old , ..."
The rooms were EXTREMELY small .
The staff was accommodating and moved us to a handicapped King room which had much for space for nights 2 3 .
We could not imagine the petite rooms .
We upgraded to a Deluxe Queen room and was surprised by how tiny that room was .
In July we went up ...
My fianc and I LOVE NOLA !
"The location is perfect , only a few blocks from Bourbon , Jackson Square and Decatur !!"
The only place we stay in NOLA!
The staff is wonderful and always very accommodating !
We 've been two times in the last year and both times we stay at the Omni Royal .
We stayed in July of 2015 and October of 2015 .
"Also , the pool is probably the best of any hotel pool and you really have to have the pool when it 's around 90 degrees in the spring and summer ."
Great Pool and Views!
I highly recommend this hotel !
This hotel was Amazing !
"Though it 's not as hip as the W Hotel , The location is amazing - right across the street from K - Pauls and Nola 's - two great restaurants ."
Excellent Hotel in French Quarter
I have stayed many times over the past several years at this classic hotel .
I highly recommend requesting a room on the ...
The pool is rooftop and has great views of the city .
The rooms have very comfortable beds with modern flat screen TV's .
The service from the front desk to the room attendants to the bartenders are top notch .
"I am native to New Orleans , but live elsewhere currently , so I KNOW EXACTLY where to stay when visiting ."
"The hotel has entrances on both Royal ( cafes , galleries , boutiques ) and Chartres ( Jackson Square ) , so it is central to EVERYTHING in ..."
"The location is PERFECT , the hospitality is war and welcoming and the rooms are well appointed , spacious , quiet and comfortable ."
The ONLY place to stay in New Orleans!
( You NEVER want to stay on Bourbon Street !! )
Best Location for everything NOLA!
"It is in the middle of the French Quarter , but not on crazy Bourbon Street ."
"Our room overlooked Royal Street , which is a beautiful street lined with art galleries , ..."
The hotel was clean and elegant .
The Omni was the PERFECT hotel .
This was our first time visiting the city of New Orleans .
Great Location in French Quarter
"I recommend the larger rooms over the smaller ones , since the small rooms are really ..."
It is literally steps from some of the classic restaurants in New Orleans and close to Bourbon Street while still allowing for a good night 's sleep .
The staff was friendly and helpful without being overbearing .
We always stay at this hotel when visiting New Orleans .
Absolutely LOVED this hotel .
Accommodations were great .
"Big beds , big rooms , big bathrooms and an amazing 360 ..."
Classy and polite staff .
Our banquet food was delicious and always fresh throughout the day .
Should be a 5 star
Staff would whisk away all dishes and place settings when we were finished and my glass or cup was never empty .
"Truly the best service , food and location ."
A respite from the bustle of Bourbon Street
"Rooftop pool and bar was terrific , a great place to view the City and River during the day or night ."
"We did n' the try the hotel restaurant , since we were tempted by the aromas of other restaurants while walking the French Quarter ."
We spent two relaxing nights at the Omni .
"Wonderful room , helpful staff ."
"I would like to say thank you to all the staff , for our stay at the Omni ."
"Loyalty Ambassador Tia A. Jackson contacted me in advance of our arrival and had ask if we had a special occasion , and I responded yes it was our 40th anniversary of our ..."
The hotel is impeccable in every way
We were very much surprised when we got to the hotel .
So perfect for walking back from bourbon street without problems and close enough to walk to where you need to go in French Quarter .
The hotel is located on an excellent and very convenient block .
The hotel lobby doorman is a nice upscale ...
"Very close to the action , but about a block away from the action at the same time ."
Very nice place to stay
Fabulous fun at a great hotel in the middle of the French Quarter !
"Friendly , helpful staff , lovely clean , comfortable room ."
Great to know that after a very full day you could come back to such a lovely home .
I ...
Omnificent
"Right in the middle of all the action , it was our base for a group visit to the Nola jazz festival ."
Also at some point the AC was so loud
As long as you do not end up in a room next to the elevator . ( a lot of noise )
"Definitely the location is there best attribute ! , and staff are pleasant ."
"However ,"
Location is good!
"You feel as if you are in Engine room , As long as you do n't need Wi Fi ( available ..."
Good Location for Hotel .
I was awakened my first evening four times by two pit bulls barking beside me .
Naomi
Pets are allowed .
Rib Room prices are also too high .
Rooms with a balcony are the way to go .
Staff moved us to different room next day .
Valet parking is too expensive .
You do not know which rooms they allow Pets .
Perfect location
The Riviera bar and pool on the roof is a nice amenity to have so you can relax for a few hours before the night life .
The room was very clean and you ca n't beat the location .
You are walking minutes from whatever you want to do in the French Quarter .
My husband and I just returned from a 3 night stay .
Since it was our first time visiting and we were celebrating a special occasion we booked a king suite with a balcony .
The balcony was amazing - we overlooked ...
The extra price tag was worth it .
We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and it was our first time visiting NOLA .
Wonderful Hotel with the Perfect Location!
Everything is right on point .
I travel a lot and this is my new favorite spot in NOLA !
It was quiet in the hallways .
The hotel was full but I would 've never known .
"The location , staff and hotel are fabulous !"
This is the place to stay.....stop searching!!
Enjoyed My Stay
Found the hotel to be conveniently located and tastefully decorated .
I would definitely stay here again .
It 's so nice to be able to open the French doors and let the sounds of New Orleans into your room !
"Loved the rooftop pool , we were lucky enough not to have had too many children to deal with ."
"My room was great : clean comfortable and again , tastefully decorated without looking suburban - generic ."
Service was polite and prompt .
Try to get a balcony room if you can .
"Love the OMNI for many reasons , the only thing that is a huge disappointment each visit is the cigarette smoking being done in the outdoor areas that we are supposed to be able to enjoy fresh air ( the pool , balconies , front door entrance ) ."
"Perfect stay, except for cigarette smoking issues"
"Rules need to be enforced , rude guests get mad if approached about taking smoking to appropriate areas ."
"For American standards , the room is small ."
If you ...
"Omni Royal Orleans offered convenient location , and loads of amenities ."
The staff is gracious and really makes you feel at home from the second you arrive outside the front entrance .
"There is a restaurant downstairs where we had an excellent meal , and the lobby bar was fun and relaxing for cocktails ."
Walk ANYWHERE in the French Quarter from this Historic Hotel
Booked the hotel through a package deal and got a great deal .
Cant beat the location of this hotel .
Great location!
It s a block away from Bourbon street and minutes away from Jackson Square and other attractions .
No complaints overall .
Plenty of restaurants near by .
Staff was extremely pleasant .
The rooms were nice and clean .
Fun In New Orleans
I give it a 5 star rating .
It was just down the sidewalk from Bourbon street but far enough to get away from the late night partying .
"Very friendly , great location in the French Quarter very comfortable ."
One of the best stays I've ever had!
The hotel staff were so very nice .
"The location of this hotel is perfect , right in the midst of downtown but not so loud that one can not rest ."
The room was very clean and beds were extremely comfortable .
"We had the best time and this hotel , by far , is one of my favorites ."
We love the City of New Orleans ...

Good Rooftop ...
Great Value in NOLA
"Location is excellent , good service and friendly employees ."
"Rooms are small ( we upgraded to a deluxe room / queen ( still small ) but clean , comfy and great water pressure in the shower :) ."
This was my first visit to NOLA and chose the Omni on a friends recommendation - was very pleased .
I can not say enough about every aspect of this property and I will be staying there for certain on my next trip to New Orleans !
Met all of our expectations....and a lot more!!!
We basically picked this hotel off the internet by the nice picture .
What a pleasant treat it was right from beginning to end !
But they are very clean and well maintained with one of the most comfortable beds I 've slept in .
"Lovely hotel , great pool , decent gym , good food , lovely courteous staff , perfect location ."
Only slight criticism is the rooms could be bigger .
Wifi is free if you are staying there - just ask ...
You really wo n't find better in the French Quarter .
You won't find better in the French Quarter
All the staff was beyond fantastic .
"Everyone had a great time , the location of the property could not have been better ."
Had our daughters wedding at the Omni Royal Orleans .
The quality of the hotel is great .
We had a suite and it was perfect .
Wedding Weekend
A nice touch was a filled ice bucket when the bed was turned for the night .
Good for pleasure but not business
Place was clean and in a very good location .
Pleasurable stay other than terrible internet service .
Rooms were quiet and special rooms in the hotel were easily accessible .
Transportation was easily available .
Awesome Anniversary
Information was readily available and the hotel was really clean .
My husband and I visited NOLA to celebrate our first wedding anniversary this past weekend .
Room service was excellent and speedy .
"The room was lush but small - neither of us minded , since we would be tourist hopping and eating all day any ... view moreway ."
"The view was great , and we were pleased that it was located far enough from Bourbon that you could n't hear the crazy screaming drunkenness ( though , Saturday was a bit louder than Friday ) ."
"There was a mix up with the room key which stalled our ' settling ' for 30 minutes , but we were told that the woman that assigned us the keys was on medication from a dental operation ."
"Upon our late arrival , we were greeted by the Valet and Bell Boy and quickly checked in for our stay ."

"We did n't get to explore the upper deck pool area or dine at the Rib Room , but plan on staying here again - it 's in the middle of everything and a really great value !"
Lovely roof Pool and bar .
Outlets on side of bedside table .
Service was fabulous from fast check in to housekeeping to wake up calls .
"Service, location fabulous"
Stayed 3 nights for a conference .
"The rooms are small as this is a historic property , but very nicely decorated , clean and comfortable ."
"There are dimmers on the lamps , robes and nice sheets ."
Excellent!!
I 've stayed in many hotels in New Orleans .
Our room was n't ready .
Pool was clean and had a nice view with a breeze .
Staff was friendly .
Thank You !!!!
They finally gave us a room just to sleep in until our room was ready .
This one is my favorite .
We arrived early and we had n't slept .
Will definitely be back !!
Hotel is on an old building but nicely renovated .
"Noise is a problem , though bring ear plugs or ask for a room that does n't face the street side , as the party goes on all night ."
Old town New Orleans
Stayed at this property while on a convention .
Finally Made a reservation with Omni after many attempts .
"Made a reservation to check in May 28th , three nights ."
Requested early check in This was a special ...
Should have been a warning on things to come I finally called the front desk and they connected me to reservations .
Their reservation system would put call on hold for a long time .
Zero Stars. Awful Start to New Orleans trip
Bell staff is tops - best of all hotels we have ever stayed with .

Much better now than in recent past .
Rooms have recently been renovated .

"Clean room , comfortable beds , nice location and a friendly staff ."
Good :
Nice room
One additional chair in the bedroom would have been great .
"As I have come to expect from Hilton properties overall , the hotel was nice ."
Bad : We felt that the hotel was overpriced for the amount we paid .
Good :
Neither my wife nor I felt that it was worth 265 a night .
Not Worth the Cost
Our room was well appointed and comfortable .
We get a better value from Hampton Inns .
"We make it a point to stay at Hilton properties whenever possible , and this was our first visit to a Hilton Garden Inn it will probably be our last ."
"While the property was nice , it was not what I expected for the price ."
Bad : Outside the center and hard to reach without car !
Good :
Good offer for the price !
Good offer for the price!
Internet usage requires registration with many personal details .
"And , the HVAC in the room was balky , loud , clunky and less than adequate ."
Bad : The television was so small that it could barely be seen from the bed .
Breakfast was a real value and the size of the room was really large .
Good : Location for me was excellent .
"Some good, some bad."
"The fitness room was way below par , only two working machines ."
Bad : Lavatory very small for a large bathroom .
Lavatory very small for a large bathroom.

Bad : Shower liner needs replacing .
Bed very comfy !

Our favorite !!!!
That was just perfect in the late afternoon after coming back from Williamsburg !!
Upgrade of toilet tissue .
Bad : Front desk guy was grumpy at check in .
"Breakfast was very confusing , half buffet half waited on ."
Clean convenient location
Good : Clean convenient location
Bad : Short on hot water during the evening .
Good :
Good value for the money .
It was fine during the morning hours .
Quiet respite spot in a busy part of town!
"Very clean , attractive ."
When I mentioned this at the desk they promised to look into it and adjusted my bill to compensate .
"excellent hotel in great position, very friendly efficient..."
"Good : excellent hotel in great position , very friendly efficient staff , great on site cooked breakfast , very good dinner menu and excellent evening bar ."
Onsite pool and gym
Well positioned for many restaurants in walking distance .
Bad : The bed was so uncomfortable that I am still soar tired a day from being home .
The bed was so uncomfortable that I am still soar ...
The curtain would not close completely to block out pole light .
Bad Corporate Meeting Place
"The rooms were fine , but the meetings were not the best and the food at the restaurant was very slow and closed early ."
We had working lunch catered and some of the sandwiches were moldy and service terrible when ...
"We hosted corporate meetings here for 15 - 20 people for about a week and in short , i will never go back again ."
"I think the room was fairly clean , even though because of the decor and color scheme , at first impression , it gave the appearance that it was n't ."
"I would recommend the property and would happily stay there again , ."
It's a decent place as a very good rate.
"The bedding was fine , though there was a hole in the bedspread ."
"The towels were clean , but there was stains that appeared to ..."
A no frills location in a residential area .
Check in was quick and not welcoming but to the point .
"Close to freeways , 7/11 , Starbucks and a Mexican restaurant / nightclub ."
Decent Stay
Parking lot could be an issue cause of the size but it was n't packed at check in so we avoided the dilemma .
"The elevator in the lobby was convenient , quick and a ..."
"It 's not the Grand Hyatt by any means , but it was clean and quiet ."
Outstanding service
Rick 's Burgers across the street had great meals for a ...
The staff was extremely helpful in assisting us as to how to get around town .
They went out of their way to see that we were helped .
We were just there for the 2012 Rose Bowl .
Bigger rooms to bigger in - room jacuzzi units to better overall atmosphere to the room .
My only issue is that I have expierienced better Wyndham hotels for cheaper prices in my area .
Service or cleanliness was not lacking here just overall quality of rooms compared to other Wyndham hotels .
Was Good not Great
Clean rooms with a decent size to go along with it is a prayer .
Traveling
When going places I like to see a landing point of a nice place of class .
Carpet so dirty that upon entering shower the foot prints would not rinse off the tub .
Dirty carpet and noisy
Laundry room directly below room would shake entire room when maids were doing laundry .
Definitely Not Worth the Money
"Not enough pillow , dingy shower curtains , bad TV reception ."
"Room almost 100.00 dollars , not worth it , will never stay there again ."
TV mounted in location that it hard to view television .
General manager was rude at checkin and would not let me checkin for an hour .
I had pre arranged to have room prepaid and he refused
Rude staff
"Love this city , A LOT !!"
Really Nice
Really nice hotel in an awesome area of Cali .
Good for just passing through
It 's good for just one night .
The motel is close to highway I - 405 and very close to LAX airport .
The surrounding can be very noisy .
We stayed one night in the motel because we had an early flight from LAX .
"came here for a business trip , they accommodated us to no end ."
great staff
The staff really did a great job tending to us !
This hotel was nice and clean .
travelodge is the place
"Walking distance to several restaurants , it was an easy drive to get there ."
fabulas rates
The location is perfect .
"the rates are fabulas , the facilities are clean ."
very impressed
I 've always stayed at the name brand hotels and did n't see anything appealing about this hotel from their pictures online .
I got a great deal on this place on Hotels.com for 81 / night .
I stayed for two nights in a room on the second floor of building 6 .
"Otherwise , I would n't have chanced it ."
Smells Like Bacon
The lobby is kind of strange .
There ...
"breads bagels yogurt fruit hard boiled eggs and cereals , perfect ."
It was quiet .
our room had a balcony with a view which is something we absolutely needed .
The staff was nice and helpfull and the breakfast was exactly what we like .
This was a great place to stay .
Thoroughly Enjoyable place
Friendly welcome .
"Nice breakfast with fresh fruit , ..."
The room had a lovely dcor .
"There was some noise from some water feature outside , but that did n't really bother me ."
"We had a room on the ground floor , which was very clean and spacious ."
"We wanted to stay away from the city in a smaller place , so we ended up in Sausalito ."
Wonderful place to stay
A wonderful experience!
The room was absolutely beautiful !
"The staff were an excellent group , ..."
"There was an ample amount available for breakfast , and the wine and cheese nights were very relaxing and fun to attend ."
"We arrived before check - in , and our rooms were ready to go ."
We met wonderful people staying at the inn with us ... made the atmosphere very friendly and homey .
And the food and beverage staff are ...
Full on dinner if you like every night at 5:30 pm with a full bar !!!
I am shocked how kind and courteous and simply nice the staff is at this hotel .
"Kind , sweet , cute , and genuinely customer oriented ."
The evening Kick Back cocktail reception is amazing as well .
The front desk ladies are fantastic .
Unbelievably outstanding staff
Pots and pans along with dishes are provided .
Terrific place to stay on the Oregon Coast.
"The mini kitchen has a full size refrigerator , microwave , oven , coffee maker with coffee provided ."
The two room suites are very clean an well maintained .
"They even have coffee sweetener , a wine bottle opener , ..."
We stay at Ocean Suites a couple of times a year and are always happy with the accommodations .
All We Lacked Was Sunshine
I noticed the ...
The decoration and practicality of the interior is very well planned .
The interior pictures of nature and local scenery provided cheerful ambience .
The property is very attractive inside and out .
"When the sun came out I noticed flower baskets hanging under the staircase on the main building and some trumpet vine , and fuchsias blooming on the hillside ."
Good Hotel great price
"My in laws stayed here and they were very happy with this hotel , clean , good price and clean !"
This is close to Pasadena City College and a close walkinto old town .
"Good location, but lacking in updates"
"Right on Colorado Boulevard , across the street from Pasadena City College , the Saga can best be described as a 1950s motor lodge ."
"That is , it s a place you can sleep in relative comfort , but the decor is sadly in need of updating ."
"The three best things about the Saga Motor Hotel : location , location , location ."
The TripAdvisor photo taken in 2011 ...
But there are plenty of places to eat in SLO so other than that it was great .
Nice hotel in SLO . staff was friendly and they had cookies and coffee when we checked in .
Nice SLO hotel
Only minor complaint was the continental breakfast was a little on the light side .
Bathrooms small .
Beds comfortable .
Breakfast was just OK No coffee in the breakfast area or choice of milk with cereal .
Good location .
Had to wait a long time for items to be refilled .
Hotel clean .
La Cuesta vs. La Costly
"Lobby very small , not ..."
Stingy on the towels .
The Negatives :
The Positives : Most of the staff was very friendly .
Too expensive for what you get .
I Would Recommend
My experience here was pretty Awesome !
The BEST!
The staff was very Helpful with whatever I needed and any questions I had about the area !
This place over and over !
Very Happy with Staying here !!
"Ca n't complain about the location , near to a lot of restaurants ."
"It has a microwave , refrigerator and coffee maker ."
nice motel
Not too much road noise .
"We found this inn very nice , well kept ."
We wanted to stay in San Luis Obispo on our way home .
Great staff and room.
My family and I got there a little early they checked the room and since it was clean they got us in early .
One of the best stays I 've had in a hotel .
The staff was very friendly and they made check - in super fast .
We will definitely be staying here again in the future .
"Check in was a bit strange , no towels pool / Jacuzzi area , lots of traffic noise from HWY 101 ."
Just O.K.
Located very close to SLO Performing Arts Center which was very convenient .
Room was clean and appointments were ok .
"The price seemed high for the accommodations , and we were given a room adjacent to the elevator , which made for more ..."
Bed was very comfortable .
Clean and spacious rooms .
Comfortable 1 night stay
Free parking .
Good varied breakfast included .
Only spent 1 night here .
San Luis Obispo itself is a very nice town !
Would recommend this motel for short stays .
Stayed for Business .
The room was small for 2 beds .
The Sheets had cigarette burnt stains .
Will not come back
Will not come back .
I paid but didnt stay
Worst place ever for family room was smelly and office staff not helpful
AC unit looked like it was going to die .
Desk was wobbly .
Furniture and fixtures were in desperate need of repair and updates .
Furniture was scratched .
Needs major renovation in the room
"Toilet seat was worn and needed to be replaced , etc ."

Laundry room clean and washers and driers very good
Nice Place
"Rooms very Clean , Kitchenette very very well provided paper Towel everything you need Except a kettle ( hey I am British ) ."
Stayed here for 10 nights
The only one very little gripe more chairs outside would be good .
"Governor Brown declared a state of emergency and more than 4,400 people from my community were relocated to hotels ."
It was our misfortune to wind up at the Hyatt Regency Valencia .
My family found our way to Hyatt Valencia as a result of a catastrophic Gas Well blow - out .
"They took FULL ADVANTAGE of the situation , of us , and even the ..."
Wish I could give them negative stars!!!
Check in was super fast and easy .
Impressed
We booked this hotel last minute .
We thought it was going to kind of A mediocre room .
When checking in the two gals at the front desk were very pleasant .
When we arrived there was plenty of parking and best of all parking is free .
When we arrived to our room we were ...
"Clean , quiet , friendly staff , nice bar , great happy hour , well located and responsive to your needs ."
It was a little noisy from other patrons slamming fire doors .
Our First Time
That came from people with no social graces .
That was not the hotel 's fault .
This Hyatt is a great place .
We will stay here again without a doubt .
"For families , it is close to Magic Mountain ."
The bar is wonderful .
"The food in Vines , the restaurant , is exceptional ."
The location of the hotel is in a very nice area with many restaurants .
This hotel has all the amenities we wanted .
We always stay at the Hyatt when we go to Valencia
We have enjoyed the wait staff tremendously every time we dine there .
"Location was close to dining , shopping and nightlife ."
"We were looking for a quick low key weekend escape to get out of the heat , without breaking the bank , Upon arrival , staff was friendly , check in was a breeze , the hotel and grounds were excellent ."
Will definitely return !
Wknd 4 2
actually she was draining .
I do n't understand this to be a view .
One of the girls at check - in had zero personality .
One of the men in Valet was loud and obnoxious! T
Outside my view room was the obstruction of a white wood gazebo .
The room service selection price and quality was excellent !
Bob
I 'll cut to chase he was no help .
I asked to speak to a manage but I was told there was not manager on duty so two hours later I finally spoke to a manager Jim who told me the charges would be reversed in 3 days ...
I still do n't know if my personal info has been compromised and I have to monitor my account everyday and the charges have still not been reversed .
I told him that was not good enough I wanted to know if my charge info and identity was compromised so I could notify my bank .
Terrible customer service .
The person working the front desk was dismissive and rude and just said
"There was a restaurant charge on my invoice for 139.00 and I contacted the front desk to notify them that I did not eat at their restaurant , charge a meal to my room or order room service so obviously someone used by credit card info on file to charge a meal ."
Very disappointed
We 'll look it to it .
Adding lots of marble flooring and mildly hip decor can not disguise some neglect and oversights that lower end chains now provide .
Decent But Unexceptional
"The Hyatt Valencia , located near Magic Mountain in non-descript Santa Clarita is a dressed up basic hotel ."
"The ice machine was out on at least two floors the night I was there , and there are no electrical outlets near ..."
Centrally located centrally located close to centres .
Great Hotel
Great place to crash after a long flight from Melbourne .
However only complaint is the balcony suit with pool views has no views
Nice grounds with swimming pool .
Room is well serviced and clean staff very friendly .
Isn't the best but does have a good bed.
It 's close to the freeway and Marie Callendars ( which has wonderful breakfasts ) .
So this is n't the best motel out there but the price is right and if you are just looking for a place to crash for a night it will do .
The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable .
Try it out you wo n't be disappointed .
You can bring your pets in the room with you .
"First of all , the owner manager both are very rude ."
Nites Inn
"Not only that , but there are a lot of cockroaches , semi-torn carpet , and the walls have black fingerprints that look like they have been there ..."
The room I stayed in was not that clean when I first checked in .
There was and probably still is writing on the walls .
Ok place to stay but nexr time i 'm in Morro Bay i will definitely look for someplace else .
"There was no phone in the room , no extra toilet paper , no clean washcloths the second and third days ."
To expensive for what you get.
Accommodations
I booked our rooms on the Internet - did n't see any accessible rooms listed or that there was no elevator .
"I did write notes as to our needs , but we were originally going to be in a room on third floor with no elevator ."
"The gal who checked us in offered a cottage on first floor for same price , which ..."
And a cosy fireplace .
It was nice to have some modern furniture for a change Breakfast was very good too but some fruit would be nice .
It was very spacious and very clean .
Nice clean hotel. And friendly staff
Oh and ...
The room was up to date as well .
We had a room on the top Floor .
Which was nice because you could see the sea
Bed was comfortable with clean sheets .
Do n't know why people complained about the continental breakfast .
Good thing no noisy people tho .
Had a first floor room and could hear upstairs foot falls but that is to be expected in any motel .
Hesitant to book after reading reviews but turned out good .
Pleasantly Surprised
Room clean and spacious .
Second night rate ( Saturday ) was way overpriced for this place .
Staff very nice .
The complainers need to realize this is not a bed breakfast or a gourmet restaurant .
"They had cereal , waffles , muffins , good coffee , juice , etc. in a clean environment ."
This motel is just a plain vanilla .
Would recommend if only staying a few days .
"I always take cleaning wipes , side of table , remote control and door handles dirty , lamp shades torn , no sprinkler system not in mine or my daughter 's room ."
"Manager very nice , breakfest good , the waffles were a nice surprise , arrears very quite ."
Would stay again if improved.
beach
We had a great time !
Good for one night
I had a hard time sleeping because it was a bit stuffy as there is no AC .
"It 's definitely not worth the rate , but considering what other hotels were ..."
"The staff is nice , room is clean and beds were comfortable ."
"This was the only place we could find that was under 200 / night , available last minute , and received decent recent reviews ."
"I found a large bug in the bathroom , someone else 's old coffee filter bag in the coffeemaker , shower curtain bar broken , and on a near freezing night ( 35 deg low ) , the heat did n't work , it only made a dangerous sounding electrical noise ."
No heat on a cold night
"Or stay was just okay , hotel in need of some work ."
Trip with grandson
I bought a night at this location off of Trip Advisor and I got a really good rate for this area .
Pacific Shores Inn
The bed was awesome I had a really good night sleep .
The view of the ocean was very tiny and I was told that if I wanted a better view I 'd have to pay more even though there were ...
"Close to beach, but old and dirty"
Coffee pot never cleaned out .
Given option to move on last night there .
Given rags to wrap around the faucet and told that no maintenance person available .
I believe she saved them and served them the next day .
"On first arrival , toilet had some poop floating in it ."
"Outlets do not work , plugs fall out ."
"Phone did not work , no dial tone , no way to contact front desk ."
"She put them away , but next morning , the muffins served were stale ."
"Sink had leak , which soaked the entire counter top ."
Towels received were stained .
"Went to continental breakfast , and muffins were covered with ants ."
Great Stay
Our room was spacious and included a refrigerator and microwave .
The accommodations were clean and comfortable .
This was no problem and the front desk woman was very courteous .
"We arrived late ( after 9 pm ) , so we called ahead to let them know ."
We felt the hotel was a good value for the price .
"Good location , walking distance to shops and restaurants ."
Just a few minutes from the beach .
"Simple, cozy and convenient"
And no decaffeinated coffee .
Coffee pot only makes 2 tiny cups of coffee anyway .
Water pressure was low .
WiFi was bad spent four days there and got on WiFi 2 times .
Won't stay there again
Great Location at Foot of the Flats in Cleveland
It 's designed for a younger traveler who does n't care for many creature comforts ... do n't look for ...
The Aloft Cleveland is located at the beginning of the Flats area in downtown Cleveland .
This Starwood propety is a trendy hotel with uniform rooms ... all rooms look alike and offer the bare minimum in decor .. a very comfortable bed .. nice stall shower ... not no comfy chairs or real decor ....
A Hip addition to Cleveland Downtown waterfront!
In Cleveland on a weekend trip to visit my daughter .
It 's in the center of a growing nightlife on the water front of downtown .
Our room faced the popular Punch Bowl club and it was clearly ...
"The hotel is hip , modern and new ."
We booked through Travelocity and got a more than reasonable rate for airfare and lodging at Aloft .
Came out here to see my friends band play at the flats just across the street from Aloft !
Cool view of some huge bridge !
Great food all around and walking distance .
Great place to stay !
Great stay location!
Right next to the water ( always stoked when I 'm near water ! )
Rooms were clean and very modern !
The hotel is in a great location !
Would ...
Neighbors make a difference.
Shoney's is right next door and the Carroll 's General Store is just a quick drive behind the motel .
This made all the difference in the world .
Overnight
"Wi- fi was hit or miss , breakfast was not good ."
Convenient
It was a good clean stay .
Bed was comfy as were the pillows .
By far one of the best HIE i have stayed at !
Excellent stay!
It is not that often and usually not in larger cities .

"I did n't use the area , but saw kids in and out all day / night and parental supervision is required which is nice ."
I was on my way to Cincinnati and stopped over for the night .
If you have kids they will like the pool and splash park .
My room was very nice and the area was nice and quiet .
Nice stop over
Great accommodations and management
"Several years ago during an area ice storm and widespread power outage , our family checked into this hotel ."
Superior ...
"The room was clean , comfortable , and met all of our needs ."
We were able to obtain a room at a significantly reduced rate which shows the generosity and helpful community spirit of the Daly family who own / manage this and other businesses .
Front desk was ignorant to whole event even tho you could see outside tables from lobby .
Never stay ...
Room was below average with door that seemed broken and toilet rocked on floor .
Unconcerned personnel with indifferent attitude was the worst .
Very loud .
Wedding party outside in pool area until 4:30 in morning .
Worst night at a hotel in 30 years .
Worst night ever
Loved the bright color scheme and all the big fluffy towels in the bath .
Perfect hotel for passing through the area.
Stayed one night and it was perfect for our travel plans .
"The hotel is quiet , clean and up to date ."
The lighting a bit dim in the bathroom but overall a perfect ...
The staff was friendly and efficient .
The water pressure was out of this world .

Every year we stay somewhere different because we have n't found THE ONE .
Finally found a nice place!
Great property !
"Perfect for those evenings that that are too windy , ..."
The room are clean ... NO BUGS !!!
This is it !!!
We found THE ONE !!!!
"We having been coming to Hollywood , FL for quite a few years now ."
Good place to stay on the Gulf Coast

The lady who took care of the breakfast bar was especially attentive .
The QI in Weeki Watchee is far enough enough away from Tampa to be out of the madness that is US - 19 yet close enough for daytrips to the Tampa area as well as up the Gulf coast .
Very reasonable rates .

Great for the price!
My family and I drove about 4 hours to visit Weeki Watchee Springs very early Saturday morning and had reserved a room for the same night sine it 's less than a mile from the park .
The hotel was very accommodating and ...
When we got to Weeki Watchee the park was already full and we did n't really have a plan B .

Thank You to everyone at Ramada who made my stay such a memorable one .
A very disappointing stay at Ramada
I am employed at one of the leading hotels in Barbados and was very disappointed with the service of the hotel and ...
This was our first vacation that we could not wait to get back home .
We are repeat guests to Ramada but sadly this will be our last stay as we will be looking to take our family elsewhere .
"A / C a bit noisy , but working fine ."
"As stated in previous reviews , they do have the slowest elevator in the world ( but it is working ) ."
Everything in working order .
Good value
"Overall , Hotel is showing its age here and there , but it is good value for the price ."
Rooms spacious and updated recently .
Stayed for a total of eight days .
The guest ...
Extremely rude clerk who answered me in the checkout
I will not return
They offer storage of luggage service but not allowed to leave the luggage after checkout .
Very strong smell in the hallways I was in the last room on the second floor and the internet did not work
A woman possibly seeking trade was buying beers from the shop ...
"Dirty, poorly maintained, seamy activity in lobby"
"Our reaction confirmed by a fellow traveler , returning from Ecuador , the next morning -- her bathroom had pipes leaking brown fluid in wall ."
"There 's a newer Ramada closer to the airport , but because Ramada appears to be all franchise , you never know what you 're getting , and this was bad ."
Checkout took for ever and they do n't know how to explain things .
I do n't even know how this place is still operating .
Not helpful whatsoever .
Please send those ladies to customer service ...
The AC in some rooms do n't work .
The girls at the checkout desk are rude and confrontational .
Their faces depict people that are being forced to work ...
Unprofessional !
Worst place ever!!! Save your time and money!!!
"Great hotel, great location and GREAT staff"
"usually when we walk into a place with our 3 crazy boys we are instantly judged or get eye rolls , but she was so friendly and engaged ..."
we were here one night with our 3 boys and I have to say that the girl that checked us in and checked us out ( same person but forgot her name ) was awesome !
All smiles .
Great stay love the see through shower .
I enjoyed playing pool .
I was booked extremely fast .
Love Couple
My reservation was confirmed but not booked .
The decor is fabulous and sheik
The service was fast and very friendly .
"Great Location, Slow Food Service"
I went here with friends from work and we had a good tome .
Only drawback was the slow food service as it took over an hour for chicken tenders .
Probably would go to a different place next time .
They have a small bar area but was good enough for the ten of us .
Bathroom spacious .
Clean modern hotel with friendly staff .
February 6 stay
Free internet .
My first stay in Aloft hotels .

"Personal so nice and attentive , the place is so beautiful and dog treats !!"
This was more than we expected !
We love this place !
We were looking for a nice hotel to stay for a couple of days and we wanted to take our dog for her first trip ..
I enjoyed the casual atmosphere .
It was clean and the grounds were well kept .
Prices were appropriate .
The motel has a pleasant classic feel and appearance which is slowly disappearing from our cities .
The pool area is nicely set up .
"Well kept classic motel, good character"
"Heated pool ... i can go on and on , but they are my reviews , enjoy your stay , i guarantee you will go back ...."
"I had so much fun at the pool , you can even cook at the pool , courtious service by the staff , fred , bonney , catalina .. just ask and they get whatever you need , grace and fonze are the owners and they are just great people ."

My family stayed here over the July 4th holiday .
"The feeling of camping, but with a solid roof over your head and a private bath!"
"The kids were all able to play and swim , we could have group meals and sit by a campfire ..."
This location was perfect .
"We all enjoyed the camping experience , but wanted an alternative to a tent ."
We were with 5 other families who had previously gone camping together for several years .

As usual Hampton Inn is good and doing everything to make your stay a good experience
Good overall experience Breakfast is always a strongest point of any Hampton Inn Location is the best for people looking to eat around because it is located in industrial - office type complex Close to I - 95
Hampton will not dissapoint you
saved a few

"stayed in two other similar hotels this trip , service here was really accommodating and friendly , nice touch"
Hope to return next year to run the marathon again .
Maine Coast Marathon Trip
My family and I were overly pleased with the staff especially housekeeping .
Traveling with a 4 and 1 year old can be challenging and the staff assisted with a couple bumps in our trip and made us fell welcomed .
Breakfast ladies were super friendly and made sure everyone had what they wanted and were not rushed to clear everything off the shelves like some places are .
Clean and comfortable .
"Great Stay in Saco, Maine!"
I would stay again !
Made us feel relaxed and welcome there .
Thank you !
Check elsewhere
"The mattress is very old and worn down , quite lumpy with the edges collapsing ."
Upon checking in we spent the next 15 minutes chasing and squishing black bugs around the floor .

Great concept with the free evening snacks and free soda .

Good but not great
Great value !
Note : this is priced at a 3 - star level .
"The dinner / breakfast were satisfactory , but maybe not up to par with other Drury Inns we 've stayed at ."
"The room was exactly what we expected - perfect , what you 'd expect from a 4 - star hotel ."
We ended up ...
But because of the reviews decided to give Drury another chance .
Do not hesitate to stop at this hotel .
Glad we did .
Great stop
Have not stopped at a Drury Inn in quite a while .
The last time we did was not a good experience .

Hotel is in the heart of shopping and dinning .
I stay here often and will not stay any place else .
Incredibly clean and superb staff .

Try it once and I bet you never stay anywhere else while in ...

"Lovely big rooms , with big beds and the nicest bathroom I have seen in all our hotels on this trip ."

"I am a tried and true Marriott person , but my husband booked this hotel as a surprise for our anniversary ."
"The king suite had alot of room , a nice view and a fireplace ."
The staff was very nice and the breakfast bar was very good .
This is a good hotel to stay at if you ...
2 rooms were booked online by different parties at different times on same night .
met our needs very well
"She put us side - by - side facing the courtyard , which was very nice for visiting with each ..."
"The young lady who checked us in ( around 10 PM , 8 - 14 - 15 ) was great ."
"We really only needed rooms to sleep in , as we were in the area visiting family friends ."
Not impressed
The access to the property was not very well marked so it was very easy to miss the turn into it upon first arrival .
The door was very warped and drafty ...
The window to the room would not open as it appeared to be half of a sliding window .
The wood around the window was OSB that was just painted .
Our one night at this roach mo...
Our one night at this roach motel was awful .
The water in the bathroom ran lukewarm in the shower and sink .
There was no remote for the TV .
"They screamed , yelled , slammed doors , and stomped back and forth for two hours ."
This roach motel is not worth the money .
Two of our towels were a gross grey color .
We asked for a non-smoking room but clearly someone had been smoking in our room quite recently .
We had to leave without being properly checked out .
"When we went to check out , there was no one available ."
"While the manager on duty was very pleasant , our room was less than satisfactory ."
"Worst of all , the people on either side of us decide ... view mored to stand outside and talk very loudly until midnight ."
Friendly and welcoming
I wish we stayed longer but we were only there for a night before a cruise .
The continental breakfast was good thanks to fresh make your own waffles .
The room was clean and to our expectations .
The staff is really what made this hotel great
"The staff was great , very helpful and friendly ."
The view was good looking out over the canal but I wish I had asked for a higher room for the view .
( Take water shoes with you as is stoney going into the sea ) .
"A quiet, smaller hotel which is great for chilling out"
The hotel is located about a 15 - 20 minute stroll from a sandy beach .
"The room had a settee , chair and TV which was set up like a loung area , a fridge , crockery , cutlery ..."
"We had a lovely room ( 303 ) which had a soft , comfy bed and ample pillows ."
"Breakfast was definitely a plus , but nothing fancy ."
Good base of operations for our stay on Oahu
Nice room and friendly staff .
WIFI was good .
23rd October 2015 to 30th October 2015 .
Amazing relaxing hotel
It was the first time to Hawaii for both of us and it is one holiday that we will be repeating .
Myself and my daughter ( 11 ) have just spent 7 nights at the amazing Coconut Waikiki Hotel in Honolulu - our girlie holiday .
Oahu is the most relaxing destination that I have been ...
And they took the time to customize our accommodations .
And what 's not to love Great location + great service great time .
Chech in / out was the smoothest process I ever experienced .
Coconut Waikiki is bringing sexy back
Front desk staff really embodied the aloha spirit .
Heated pool and fresh homemade waffles at continental breakfast was an unexpected treat .
Hotel is energy concious which I loved about them .
"Coconut Waikiki is a very nice Hotel , just far enough away from the main touristy areas to suit us ."
Just make sure when you arrive at the Hotel that you use the ramp ( drive way ) access and do n't try and drag your bags up the entry stairs !
Location suits first time visitors!
"Rooms are ample , clean and well maintained ."
There is also a laundry room and ...
Even a free bottle of wine for our celebrations !
I mean it is way ...
It 's so convenient to shopping malls and Waikiki beach !
"Pretty mountain views , great riverside ..."
Sunshine in the mornings .
They tried their best to make you feel at home !
U can not imagine how wonderful the view is .
We got a mountain view room .

The hotel is at the Canal end of Lewers Street .
The staff at the hotel are very friendly and always willing to share their local knowledge about good places to dine .
"Affordable, Great Stay!"
Always asking how our day was going and what ...
Room was average from what we 've heard about small rooms in Hawaii .
The overall hotel it self was was not bad .
The staff was our favorite part about the staff they were all VERY friendly and helpful .
There included breakfast could be better .
We had a private balcony which was nice .
Breakfast was supplied but a little limited in selection .
"Hotel within easy reach of the beach , shopping and bus routes and the activity coordinator at reception was very useful Room had a kitchenette with fridge which was a definite plus although benches and cupboards much higher than standard ..."

We stayed there for our honeymoon and it was such a great experience .
"As a loner tourist , it makes a difference to have super friendly , efficient and helpful staff ."
I have to speak of the staff first because they were all spectacular - could not fault a single person !
"In regards to location , ..."
Just what I needed!
This little hotel lived up to my expectations of a JDV hotel ( I 've stayed at Shoreline previously and loved it ) !
"Room was nice , recently updated and comfortable ."
"The location was walking distance to all the Waikiki attractions such as the beaches , etc , but far enough away that it was quiet ."
The staff was great -- friendly and responsive .
"Updated Rooms, Ok Location"
"However , when we settled in , our impressions changed and by the time we ..."
"Initial reaction to this hotel was that it was a bit basic , small bathroom , and probably could do with a makeover ."
"This hotel is not on the beach ( 10 minute walk away ) but overlooks the canal which runs parallel to the beach , 2 blocks back ."
"Very friendly, clean in a great location"
"Creates noise constantly 24 / 7 with loud music , loud motorcycles and cars because it is a very busy street ."
It is possible that a room on a ...
Sleep may be elusive for travelers that need quiet for sleep .
The Blvd .
The noise easily filters into the hotel room .
Traffic noise easily heard from hotel
We have a 3rd floor room Mountain Side View facing Ala Wai Blvd .
"Before I came , I saw that it had 4 stars on Yelp and pretty high ratings here , so I booked a one - night stay to check it out ."
"Check - in was easy , and Monique was very welcoming and friendly !"
First Visit to Hawaii!
I actually booked this hotel while I was on the plane to Oahu .
I was a bit disappointed with the city view but ...
Coconut Waikiki is our new favorite Waikiki home !
New Favorite!
"The staff , rooms and even the other guests were all just right ."
We 're all looking forward to many many happy returns .
We 've had many delightful visits to Waikiki and stayed in assorted hotels .

The Coconut Waikiki Hotel was a great hotel .
"The location itself was excellent , it was close to ..."
The room was bright and clean .
The Wifi was fast .

Having the continental breakfast was an added bonus for us .
Hawaii layover

"The only thing for us was the street noise , even being on the 9th floor ."
The view ...
"We enjoyed our stay a this property , all staff including Housekeeping were very friendly and helpful ."
"Although this hotel was not off the beach , it was just a small walk down from all major shopping and beach area ."
Hotel was recently redone and is much nicer than some of the higher priced hotels along beach front .
I wish we had stayed here for the entire stay .
The neighborhood has great little pubs and small shops and restaurants that you might want to check out as well .
Well worth it!
You get to control your a/c .
I came with my boyfriend who was visiting me from out of town and I live in Hawaii so we decided to spend a night here .
The hotel staff was very friendly and gave us a room upgrade and a bottle of wine to share and enjoy on them for staying with ...
The hotel was small but looked newly renovated .
Very Pleased!

I stayed here after a long day of traveling and the staff could have not been any more accommodating .

The staff is very nice and attentive .

Breakfast was not great for us but we are pretty fussy and ...
Great hotel in an overpriced city
Mike who sorts luggage / valet cars is great - a gem !

They have the right attitude for the jobs they do .
We only stayed one night but enjoyed our stay .
Great little hotel!
My friends and I stayed at this hotel earlier this month and could not have been happier with our choice !
The location was exactly where we wanted to ...
The rooms were nice and very clean .
We had a room with two beds overlooking the mountains and canal and it was a good amount of space for the three of us .
But the worst thing of all is ...
My husband and i went to Hawaii to celebrate our honeymoon .
Once we arrived we got a whole other opinion about the hotel .
One of the worst hotels i've ever stayed at
"Staff was not friendly , rooms were old fashioned , pool was very small .."
When we searched for hotels we found the coconut waikiki hotel which seemed to look good on pictures .
"But Coconut Waikiki was a neat , well priced and well located place to stay in expensive Waikiki ."
I did n't actually put any lime in a coconut nor did I shake it all up - I am way too old for that .
"It 's a brief meander from the hotel to the beach , with about 342 ABC stores along the way ..."
OK .
You put the lime in the coconut and...
I would say that the friendly staff were what made our stay here most enjoyable .
Very friendly staff and beautiful location just a few blocks back from the main street of shops .
Very Happy
We had a great stay at the hotel .
Would highly recommend to anyone travelling to Waikiki .
Great Location
Hotel is a little old but its clean .
I would recommend staying here but do n't expect it to be like the Hilton or Sheraton .
"Location is great ,"
"Staff are very friendly and are always happy to help , Breakfast is included which was nice also"
Bars were down the street with great happy hour and the royal Hawaiian center had plenty shops and a food court !
Everybody was so friendly and helpful !!
I love staying at the coconut Waikiki !!
I loved waking up to the sunrise and how conveniently close the shops were .
Loved it
Minutes away from ...
The breakfast was amazing and the rooms so relaxing !!
But it only walking distance to the beach .
Convenient and friendly
I 'd do it again in a heartbeat .
"I also like the fact , that it 's off of the busy street ."
I stayed here on a work trip for 8 nights .
"My room was clean , breakfast was nice , staff was friendly !"
They also do valet services which is nice .
Friendly hotel
Stayed here as part of a bigger American adveture with my new husband !

The hotel was very centrally located and very close to all the tres fancy shops and beach !
The staff were friendly and were always on hand to recommend good local restaurants .
We had a mountain view room which was big and always kept clean and tidy .
"Location was ok , just a quick walk to Fred Meyers the bus stop ."
No a/c which might be ok on the other side but we were on the side facing the sun and it was quite ...
Right price
"Room was tiny and old but clean , which matters the most ."
Staff was very friendly .

Easy to get to .
Friendly staff with no frills comfortable accommodations at a fair price .
Great downtown location with easy access to local businesses and downtown historical points .
Great Location.
Within walking distance to downtown tourist attractions .
But I just ignored the kitchen area and the hotel was better than fine .
I 'm not really a big fan of this type of suite .
I can not ...
Pleasing Surprise
"The amenities nice ( free wi - fi was dependable , that 's unusual ) ."
The bed was very comfortable .
The last thing I want to do on a vacation is cook or do dishes .
The rooms were spotless .
"I might be wrong , but Kingman does not have much to offer to tourist ."
"The Ramada hotel is located in Kingman , in Arizona ."
The Ramada thou is a perfect location for those who are travelling and would like to spend a couple of days relaxing before starting another long trip across the desert .
Very nice hotel at affordable price
Beds were clean and fresh and bathroom counter sparkling .
"Luckily , half of ..."
Nice but with some flaws
"The room 's door latch did not fully function when used from the outside and we had real trouble getting into the room every time , to the point of shoulder ramming the door to get in ."
The room was clearly not vacuumed and the bathroom floor not cleaned either .
As I was checking in the front desk / manager told me that my room was a problem room 312 because people smoke in it .
I have stayed at this hotel several times and every time something little was wrong but we overlooked it .
She said there was a smoke smell and smoke burns .
TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE
That was the least of the problems when ...
EVERYONE we encountered was incredibly nice and accommodating
"Everything was clean , our room , the pool area , and bar ."
I only had one issue and that was the continental breakfast .
"I used to live in Clarksville and kind of knew what to expect here Hotel - wise , but was very pleasantly surprised when it came to the staff !"
"It was awful , but then again are n't they all"
Perfectly fine place to stay!

TN summer visit
We had driven several hours that night just to make it to TN .
"A pool, Breakfast, and, well, bugs."
"Good price on the rooms , the breakfast was fine but one of the rooms had bugs ."
I wo n't be going back .
The replacement room appeared to be bug free .
Comfortable home on the Range
Did not have a chance to use the pool or exercise area but there is a lovely walking trail around the hotel .
"Rooms were comfortable and clean , bed was great , staff was friendly and helpful ."
This hotel met Hampton 's high quality standards .
"This is why I stay at Hampton 's , you know in advance of the quality of service ."
We stayed ...
I had stayed at this Hampton Inn many years ago and it was the typical Hampton .
My wife and I were very impressed by the room and the friendly staff .
Next door to Applebees and in close proximity to many restaurants and not too far from UGA and downtown Athens .
Really Nice! A pleasant surprise
They have upgraded since and the accommodations are very nice .
"although the initial nonsmoking room selected on line was found to have the lingering smell of smokers , the front desk staff did not hesitate to relocate us to a similar room that met our expectations ."
Hampton Inn Athens
no hassles .
Great Hotel
I 've always tried to stay in hotels in downtown .
"I 've never had any issues with this brand of hotel in the past , but ..."
I travel to Athens several times a year and have been for the past 14 or so years .
There are n't that many and this particular they were all booked so I made reservations at the Hampton Inn .
"Athens, GA"
Hotel currently undergoing renovation .
Nice area with good location .
"Some worn / dingy room furniture , but will probably be replaced after renovations are complete ."
Very clean and pleasant .
Very friendly and helpful staff .
"( I am willing to sacrifice a good bit just to pay less but , my aunt wanted to stay there ) ."
Hampton Inn-what you would expect
It was more expensive than I normally pay .
It was very clean and nice .
The staff was friendly and helpful .
You will like it .
I arrived late at night at 1130 pm a signboard told me to check in at econolodge .
I redirected the taxidriver to econolodge at the bottom ...
"luckily , I saw the signboard before my taxi left ."
"spacious room, afterhours arrival need to check in at econolodge"
"The chalet inn is priced very reasonably , The room is spacious with a lounge area ."
The lobby is rather quaint in terms of interior decor .
Blast from the past !
Even though no hot tub in our room we still had a relaxing time .
Hot Tub Time Machine
I would ask for or bring an extra blanket can get a little chilly if the fire place goes out .
Love the fireplace in the room .
Room 213
The room was outdated but yet cozy .
Will go back and stay again soon .
Comfortable and quiet
Great location to restaurants for any type you could want .
Here 's the place .
If your looking for a 5 star hotel keep looking the chair was stained .
"If your looking for a clean , comfortable , reasonably priced room with a comfortable bed ."
Little hard to find because it 's behind a convience store and a Dairy Queen .
Summit Bechtel Trip guide
The beds are small and If you request a roll a way you will need to do it at the office when you get there .
"The room is setup for 2 people , so if you have 3 or more get towels at the office first ."
This is a low price place that is close to SBR .
We use this hotel for our overnight on the way to and from the Summit Bechtel Reserve .
I am a fan of exterior doors where ...
I find this place to be a quiet place to stay .
I have never had any problems with my rooms .
Stayed here before and will stay again.
The breakfast is definitely a continental type and the ice machine is located in the breakfast room .
They have been comfy and clean and I will stay again when in the area .
"Breakfast is n't too bad , enough to get you going , coffee is good so I ca n't complain , lol ."
"Flat screen TV , microwave , refrigerator , and a great shower with nice hot water and powerful pressure ."
Great room with awesome shower
"I was very happy with my room , looks like it had been updated recently ."
There is n't anything in ...
Which is awesome after a long day at work !
Bathroom shower surround was damaged and doors were dirty .
Noise from upstairs was constant and I did not sleep at all .
The best Positive was that the room was clean and updated .
The noisiest hotel I never slept in
Unfortunately this hotel had no sound barriers between floors .
Everything looked very old and run down .
First Impression - Panic
It needs a lot of repairs or maybe just rebuild the whole place .
The room itself was clean and comfortable and had all the necessary conveniences ....
"When I first saw this motor inn , I thought there was now way I was staying at this place even though I had made reservations in advance ."
Best Hampton Inn Ever!
Hilton family hotels are my preference when I travel and I have stayed at a lot of them .
I travel extensively and normally visit at least three states per month for work .
"While not the fanciest hotel in their portfolio ( that would probably be the Waldorf Rome Cavalieri where we stayed two years ago ) , the Hampton Inn and Suites in ..."
Always ready to help .
Great family visit
She did an excellent job .
The ...
The breakfast always had something everyone wanted to eat .
"The desk staff were very nice , always smiling and asking if there was anything they could do ."
The staff went above and beyond expectations .
They never ran out of food and the lady in the kicthen was very nice and helpful .
Location good with multiple stores and restaurants nearby .
Pleasantly Surprised
"Pool area was small , but impeccably clean and enjoyable ."
"The hot breakfast was delicious and included omelets and waffles as well as cereals , breads / pastries , sausage , hash browns , hot chocolate , etc ..."
"The only minor flaw was the noise of the heat / air system , but definitely easy to ..."
"Very clean hotel , with friendly , efficient staff ."
All staff we encountered were very friendly and welcoming .
Comfortable Bed Clean Room
Complimentary breakfast was excellent for this type of hotel .
My only suggestion is that they please stock some plain black tea ( only flavored teas were available ) .
"Quick check in , clean and comfortable large room ."
Very comfortable bed and pillows .
Good luck if there is a concert in town
"If there is a concert the weekend you are looking to book , they just hang up on you ."
Low class service .
The people at the front desk are rude and not helpful .
"What do they care , the hotel is already booked ."
It was in a nice area of town with local business stores within a block of the hotel .
Nice quiet hotel
The hotel was clean and the service was excellent .
The only drawback was no fridge in room .
"This hotel was easy to get to and only 8 miles from Lake Geneva , WI ."
A very nice and new hotel .
Clean and comfortable
Each visit was good .
Have been staying here since they opened in June .
I would recommend this hotel .
"Missed not , having the pancake machine working !"
The rooms are clean and comfortable .
Great price for a great stay
"I booked this stay online which was simple to do , was checked in by a friendly staff ."
I did n't get to use the pool ...
"The room was amazing and the best I have ever stayed in , very clean and neat , beds were comfortable , price was great , and the breakfast in the morning was filling and good ."
This Hotel was wonderful .
Basic and serviceable .
Better than the other
But sparkling clean and new .
Nice staff and good location .
"No issues , would probably choose to stay he again instead of the main hotel ."
No restaurant - you still need to go to Benvenutos at the Holiday inn .
Short walk .
A night away
A perfect spot for a romantic night away .
I am a clean freak and it definitely passed all of my tests in the cleanliness department .
Overall it is a very nice ...
"The front desk staff was nice , check in and out took only a matter of minutes ."
The hotel is very nice .
The restaurant is amazing - the food is delicious .
As soon as you enter this hotel you notice it s not part of a national chain .
Best place to stay for 50 miles around
"It s not just the look and feel of the place , it s the staff ."
Our rooms were fantastic with a whirlpool ...
"This is a one - off , very hip hotel ."
Whoever is running this place has instilled a sense of pride in everyone who works there ... everyone .
I expected to see Austin Powers come out of the bathroom .
Older hotel in dire need of updating .
Yeah Baby!
Front desk
The gentleman that was there later in the evening was a blessing .
The lady at the front desk was a bit rude .
enjoyed the pool and hot tub my grandkids especially did
relaxing stay
Good for family or business travel .
Great location on the river and paths for a morning jog or walk or kayak !
Location!
"Near restaurants , friendly staff , clean and spacious rooms , and a nice breakfast ."
The little cousin to Hilton Garden Inn with just as much to offer .
Great facilities and location for a stay in Bend.
I believe you can hire bikes and ride along the river as well .
Spent a few nights in Bend and this place was fantastic .
The location is n't too ...
The location is right near the Old Mill district on the river which is a great spot .
"There are plenty of places to eat , shops and cinemas all within a stones throw ."
Fantastic accommodations and location
I only wish they had multi room suites for larger families .
My family and I stayed here for 4 nights during our 2016 spring break .
"The location is great , and the hotel is very inviting ."
Will be staying here again next time .
"Great value, very clean"
"It could use some paint on the outside , but the inside was clean , functional and exceeded our expectations ."
"No frills , but no hassle either !"
Not too far from downtown .
We were very happy to have found this place on short notice .
We would go back .
"Easy to get to , a pleasure to experience ."
Have stayed here a lot and it is always pleasant .
I do not know what else to say to reach 200 characters .
I think I 've covered everything .
Janesville Hampton Inn
"Quiet , good breakfast , clean , good pool ."
Upholds Hilton Honors reputation .
Wonderful experience again .
Breakfast was unbelievable .
Check in and Check out were a breeze !
Janesville Weekend
Room was exceedingly clean .
Room was quiet .
This Hotel exceeded every need we had .
We were expecting mediocre at best and everything was 5 Star.
As expected
"As such , there is a great deal of road noise ."
Breakfast area is very small .
Building is quite old .
Exercise room is a converted former guest - room .
Inn provides the usual predictable quality .
Single piston - driven elevator is slow .
This Hampton
This property is right off of Interstate - 90 .
"Try to get a room with a lower number , this will put you farther ..."
I stay here every time I 'm in the area ...
I tell any one in the area to stay here ...
It 's close to restaurants and really any place you want to go ...
It 's great !
Very clean and the staff is wonderful ...
worker
You just ca n't beat this hotel
Comfy and Clean Right on the River
Enjoyed a good night 's rest at the Riverside Inn which has been kept in lovely shape and affords a wonderful view off each room 's balcony right alongside the Rogue River .
Full breakfast served by helpful and friendly McKenna .
Office staff helpful as well .
Room was very clean and bed comfortable with plenty of pillows and crisp linens .
Very good value ...
"Having stayed many times at the Riverside Inn and enjoyed it , we recently stayed again and found the rooms newly decorated and a very fresh look ."
It is a very good ...
It is such a treat to sit out on the good sized deck and enjoy watching the wildlife on the river or have a picnic on a warm night .
LOVELY RENOVATED MOTEL WITH DECKS FACING ROGUE RIVER
because of our praise ... this place stays fairly booked ...
Had Me At Hello!
It started with the cheerful greeting from the front desk clerk in the small and comfortable lobby .
Our adult children wanted to stay there on their way back to Calif .
Our visit to this hotel was just wonderful !
"We were so pleased with our room , the whole experience was just delightful ."
"Based upon the pictures on line , I must say I was ..."
"Great Staff, Good Value and will be returning!"
I looked on the Riverside Inn website and decided to book directly .
This trip we were in town for a conference and when the host hotel was sold out we were referred to the Riverside Inn by the conference organizers .
"We have driven through Grants Pass , OR several times ."
RENDEZVOUS ON THE ROUGE
"staff was courteous , professional and had some personality ."
The riverside inn is such a perfect location especially if you are going to enjoy the hellgate jet boat excursion .
we enjoyed our clean and comfortable room with a river view on ...
we had a really special trip which started as soon as we checked in at the front desk ( thank you Jo ) .
Loved every minute this is where will always stay while in Grants Pass .
My husband and I spent 4 nights here .
NICE!
"Peaceful , comfortable and the owners are super nice people , very friendly and accommodating ."
This is the place to be if you are tired of generic chains .
Better places to stay for the money .
Could be cute and quaint but needs work .
"Friendly staff and informative about area , but ca n't make up for lack of care at motel ."
Not quite what we expected.
Poorly maintained facility .
Right on river so view is nice .
Everything I could have needed was available for meal preparation .
Friendly Visit
I enjoyed my stay very much .
I was highly satisfied with my accommodations .
I would recommend this facility without hesitation .
Staff were extremely knowledgeable and helpful .
The bed and pillows were of very high quality .
The room was most comfortable and spacious .
Very easy to locate and access .
I travel to Virginia for business quite frequently and wanted to try out a new hotel .
I typically stay ...
It seemed to be a half way house!
"Stayed in the hotel to try it out after very fond memories of staying in the Staybridge Suites in Ballantyne , NC ( I did a company relo and my family lived in this hotel for 6 months - just a great place ) ."
An Amazing Jewel
My king suite was spacious and very clean !!
Reserved parking spots for IHG Platinum and gold members is a plus .
The evening meals combined with ice cream socials are amazing .
"The free hot breakfast has everything you want plus yogurt , ..."
"This hotel has an amazing staff from the GM , to the front desk , down to the breakfast and cleaning crew ."
Hotel meets apartment
I was very impressed with the rooms and felt like I was in an apartment .
The kitchen ...
The living area was very cozy and even with five people we never felt short on room .
We stayed in a 3 bed 2 bath suite as a way for all the bridesmaid to be in one place the night before the wedding .
Outstanding!
Service with a smile from ...
"The complimentary , hot breakfast is plentiful and tasty ."
The complimentary guest laundry was an added bonus ( bring your own soap or buy in the pantry next to front desk ) .
"We had a king suite with separate bedroom and it was contemporary , comfortable and well - appointed ."
We stayed for 11 nights and this hotel is absolutely wonderful .
* Breakfast : Outstanding !!
* Social Hour ( Mon. - Wed ...
A lot of variety .
Absolutely the best place to stay in El Paso !!!!!! * I will start with the Front Desk : Amazing !!!
Always Delicious !
"Everyone always goes above and beyond , to make sure you have an excellent stay ."
Outstanding Hotel!!!!!!! 1 for a Reason!!!!
"This hotel really is a Home away from Home , and they like to make you feel special ."
Better than I expected.
I stayed here with a school group tour .
"The bathrooms were very small and had NO HOOKS anywhere , so you could n't hang up ..."
"The rooms were fairly clean , no signs of the dreaded bed bugs ."
They prepared a breakfast buffet that was very nice every morning .
This hotel was much nicer than I was anticipating given the age and location .
Friendly and Great for Kids
"It 's a great location for kids with the fountains from the shopping center , pond , shopping and restaurants nearby ."
"The restaurant has an excellent breakfast in the mornings as part of your stay , and it 's near the major interstates for easy access to downtown ."
"Upon first glance the hotel does n't look like anything special , but there 's plenty to be excited about ."
"All our guests commented on their friendliness , and beautiful , clean rooms ."
Although it is ...
"Charlie and his efficient staff could not have been more helpful , welcoming and accommodating to our needs ."
Most of them took advantage of the inclusive breakfast next door at Hayden 's Lakeside Grill .
We recently had a block of rooms for our guests for our daughter 's wedding .

So convenient
This is the place to stay if you are visiting the university .

Can't beat it
"I travel to Corvallis nearly every month and have stayed at nearly every hotel in town and while yes this place is dated , ( orange carpet ) it was very clean , had extremely nice ..."
"Not sure what people expect out of a 54 hotel but some of the reviews I read are ridiculous .... small bathroom , what do people expect , a dance floor !"
I have stayed here many times .
"It is always very clean , friendly , and affordable ."
It s a pretty new facility but the prices are still low .
My favorite thing is that they do n't have FOX NEWS on in the lobby so I do n't have to listen to hate speech while I get my breakfast .
Nice Stay
AND it is pet friendly !!
"Ever since Danny took over La Quinta Corsicana , it has become an awesome hotel ."
excellent
It is an excellent choice and we are so grateful for them !
"It is clean , beautiful and everyone is friendly and efficient ."
The pool is heated !!
The spa is wonderful !
Motel needs some serious updates .
My spouse and I will not again stay again without some of these things are fixed .
Needs Improvement
Outside area was dirty and customers were allowed to work on their automobiles in the parking lots .
Renovations are a must .
"Rooms were large , bed was comfortable , location was adequate ."
Needs an overhaul .
Not the greatest.
"The pool is indoor / outdoor , which is pretty neat ."
"The rooms are large , but poorly air conditioned ."
The spa tub is old and needs to be updated .
There is plenty of truck parking for 18 wheelers .
Was probably once a great place .
Breakfast was good .
Family attended funeral at National Cementery
Frozen entrees for sale which was convient for travelers who did n't want to go out .
"It was clean , staff was friendly and helpful ."
"No close restraunts close , without crossing the four lane highway ."

This one actually served a hot breakfast besides to token waffle .
Very nice friendly staff .

Very good stay
Everybody is friendly and the rooms are very clean .

I had a great experience at this hotel .
I utilized the fitness center to help me maintain my work out regiment .
I would definitely stay here again because of the ease of access in location and friendly customer service .
Kendra was my favorite employee .
Breakfast was stocked and ready .
Came for a weekend with a child .
Great stay
Had no complaints at all .
Pool area was clean and the rooms were very nice .
The front desk staff was always friendly and helpful .
They are located a little off the beaten path but it was nice and quiet .
Would definitely recommend .
Excellent hotel
Lol.
Nice comfortable beds and covers .
The complimentary breakfast had a huge selection and something for everyone .
"The only draw back was it was on the expensive side , but I guess you get what you pay for because I ca n't think of anything to complain about ."
This was an excellent hotel .
Very clean and updated .
Best Holiday
"Inn we have stayed in ever and we have stayed in a few , wonderful reception from the lady at the front desk , we where upgraded to a suite and what a room , big , clean , desk lounge everything you need when travelling ."
STAY HERE
This hotel will probably make the rest of our stays in hotels across the U.S. a...
It 's only recently been built .
One of the newest....
The decor is upscale contemporay and the front desk staff were cheery and happy to see you .
The Executive King rooms bed was very comfortable with ...
This was the best .
We 've stayed in Holiday Inn Express hotels one night at a time on the way .
We are on a road trip from Chicago to CA .
Holiday Inn Express Suites west
The beds were super comfortable .
The Holiday Inn offers Wine and beer and snacks in the lobby 5:30 - 7:30 pm .
The location was right off I - 40 .
The next morning enjoy a really good cup of coffee ....
This Holiday Inn Express was very clean .
You can take the rear exit and cross the highway to eat a fantastic meal at Saltgrass Steakhouse .
A touch above
It is obvious that this HIE takes great pride in their establishment and it shows in all the little things that they do .
"We checked in late Friday evening and were warmly and expertly greeted , / Comfortable rooms / great breakfast ."
Having a small fridge was nice .
My husband and I stayed here one night on our way to Santa Fe .
One night stop over
Our room was very clean and comfortable .
The front desk folks were very friendly .
The hotel is nice and on the west side of town .
We would stay here again .
If you 're a fan of thin pillows and rock hard beds you are home .
If you love trains you will be able to hear them all night long as they blare their horn and roar past the motel !
Never stay where you see No Refunds
NOT worth 60 !
"On a Positive note , the room was clean and the towels were soft ."
"As I walked into my room , I hear the phone ring and it 's the front desk ask me to keep the noise down , I am all alone and just walked in this ..."
Horrible!! Don't waste your money!!
I 'm driving back to NC from RI and I needed to get some sleep .
I checked into this room and the front desk clerk was nice and prompt .
"Nice hotel , the room was decently clean , free parking , there are a few options on fast food and a golden corral nearby , the staff , i ca nt remember the lady , but she was very fun and kind , treat us very nice and give us a restaurant coupons for discount , the disappointing thing was the Wi - Fi , there is no free wi fi , ..."
Very nice stay
Disgusting
I 've had good experiences at other Comfort Inns so I figured this was a safe choice .
I stayed here for one night because the official hotel for the Trenton Half was booked by the time I knew I would need a room .
Not a big deal .
What was ...
When I walked in the lobby looked like it was under renovation .
Bad side of town
This hotel had a dirty pillow ( blood stains ) the shower was clogged the breakfast was horrible and the staff seemed unprofessional .
And we made the choice to return home and cancel our vacation ( we had Sesame Place and Dutch Wonderland in mind ) .
"On our way to this hotel , my daughter got sick in the car ."
Our hotel booking was non refundable and obviously we called with less ...
Thanks for understanding
We called Comfort Inn and explained our situation .
We had a reservation last month .
Exceeded Expectations!
"The key factors for us were the included mini-fridge ( not a simply cube , it had to be large enough to accommodate a 6 year old , 3 year old , and 1 year old ) , and a microwave , as well as being large enough to include a Pack ..."
We were using this hotel for a family of 5 in conjunction with Sesame Place .
"Every staff member very accommodating , welcoming and friendly !"
Philly/ Princeton Trip
Nice big rooms and clean
"They do not provide shampoo or a coffee maker but the rooms are super clean , it is quiet and the rooms are huge ."
This is a budget no frills motel but you ca n't beat the price for a clean place to sleep .
Towels are small and ...
We stayed at the Alpine for 2 nights and the price was very reasonable !
After reading the reviews about the Alpine Motel we decided to spend a night there on our way back to Canada .
Quaint Motel On The Edge of Town
The owner was quite pleasant and answer questions concerning dining and the weather which was very helpful .
There was a small fridge and a microwave in the ...
We arrived shortly after 5:00 pm and checked in to our room .
Free wifi and ice .
Great value and view with this vintage style motel .
"Great value, beautiful view, bed was average."
"Rooms are very large with updated bathroom area , fridge , and microwave ."
The mattress on one was very old and sagging on one side .
The other bed was fine .
We had two double beds in the room .
Would stay again but ask for a room with newer mattresses .
Good but not great
The staff is extremely nice but lacks the polish of staff at comparable hotels in larger cities .
This hotel is located in the center of the historic district and is a short drive from wine / farm country .
I tried to adjust the air upon arriving in a room which was 85 degrees .
No air conditioning. Doubled charged for the room
The room was nice and renovated .
We also paid for the room ...
When we can back it was still the same and when we asked the desk they said the heat was still on and brought us a fan offered to give 10 off .
Don't waste your money
Folded it ...
It took two trips to the desk to get what we needed .
Then we discovered that the sleeper sofa was hard as concrete .
We arrived at about 1'0:30 pm tired from our trip only to find out there were no sheets or pillows for the sleeper sofa .
We had a king suite with sleeper sofa for three adults .
"however , they did n't do a couple of thing right that I specifically asked for and I had to a few times during the night remind them of a couple of things ."
receiption
"the hall was very nice , food was great and the staff was the best ."
Excellent Value
It was a very comfortable stay and the staff made ...
They even offer a free YMCA pass if you want to use the facilities across the street .
This hotel is a splendid option for anyone who is to leave on a bus from the downtown area and looking for an inexpensive way to spend their last night in the city .
I went from a singke king to a double bed room .
Not happy
Not much of an upgrade
Said they upgraded me ....
I complained but was told there was no other room available .
I listened to numerous complaints from other guests while I waited in line to complain .
I was in town for business and have never stayed in a worse down town ' hotel and conference center ' in the hundreds of cities I 've traveled to .
I wouldn't suggest staying here.
The ceiling in my room and bathroom was falling and bathroom full of mold .
The front desk gentleman was indifferent to the complaints and not much was resolved .
The photos are very misleading .
Decent for money spent
Wanted a nights sleep and it was non event weekend Asked what time breakfast was Had to make the attendent laugh Got exactly what i expected A parking space A smoking room A bed A bathroom Even a refrigerator Thank you pike motel !
"After seeing it , I changed my mind about having the biscuit ."
"As I was getting ready for a biscuit , the lady refilling the biscuit tray rearranged the biscuits with her BARE hands and then with her BARE hands placed new biscuits into the tray ."
"Even with some signs of upgrades , it felt to be a very old room ."
Fresh oil? stain on pillow
I can not understand why the pillow was even left for display in the room .
I think the dcor needed to be better and the appliances upgraded .
That sight alone made me think that the rooms upkeep was not up to par .
"The bathroom did not have a fan , showering in it created a very steamy room that made the rooms mirrors useless ."
The breakfast area is very nice and has a homey feeling yet has a very contemporary style .
The breakfast offered was good and plentiful .
The first thing I spotted entering the room was the throw pillow on the bed with what appears to be a large oil stain ( hoping it is oil or grease ) in the smack center of the pillow facing right at you .
The rooms layout is very traditional going back to the older times .
The service at the front desk was speedy and very professional awesome reception with the friendliest staff .
"There is no vending machine in the hotel however , there are candies for sale prominently displayed in the main lobby ."
There was no complimentary bottled water in the room .
This hotel looks new and appears to have been newly updated .
Water pressure was awesome and the fixtures are all brand new .
Clean well - furnished room with good amenities including minifridge and microwave .
Excellent choice
Fitness room with up - to - date equipment .
I was pleased to see there was a lift to help someone with mobility problems get into / out of pool .
Nice indoor pool with whirlpool hot tub .
Staff was pleasant and professional .
"Friendly, clean, and comfortable!"
I could n't take that spring allergies would have had me sneezing all night in such a room .
"I had booked a room via a 3rd party , but arrived late and the only room available was one for people with pets ."
Nice service !
So the manager graciously gave me a suite at the same price .
At night after our meetings it was great to go to the Casino and the tavern was a cool hangout place .
Business and Pleasure
"Our company held their meetings there we had catered breakfast , lunch , and dinner by the hotel ."
This hotel was great !
. bed comfortable .
. food excellent and a huge beer selection .
. stayed 5 nights for business .
. they even have ...
. they gave you 2 free bottles of water every day in your room .
I found the room very nice .
I was unsure about staying here after reading some reviews .
The Restaurant bar downstairs was very good .
The soaps and washes were high quality .
Very clean
It is your great - grandfather 's motor inn or motor court before the word motel was coined .
Love it or hate it
"The 25 inch picture tube television , ..."
The National Trail Motel is not your grandfather 's motel .
"The room was small , but the bathroom made the room look spacious ."
Twin beds were right inside the door and there was an oversized chest of drawers and a bureau .
"I was on a long stay for work in the area and the staff is great .. treated us like family , rooms were clean , has a place to do laundry and plenty of near by restaurants ."
Long stay
They do offer breakfast and do have open wifi but the wifi is much to be desired as it does need to be faster to ...
Great place to stay
He was very helpful as I had to move some boxes that needed to remain at ambient temperature into my room .
I arrived very late and checked in quickly thanks to the gentleman at the front desk .
It was very clean and quite roomy .
Te room was perfect .
"The bathroom , as others have mentioned , may be on the small side ..."
All of the shops and restaurants are walkable from this hotel and the staff was great .
Breakfast is also included which is an added bonus .
Great location
My girlfriend and I were stayed one night here and loved the location .
"Parking is the only negative , which is 20 on site and 5 two blocks away ."
Breakfast was awesome .
Classy and not pretentious
Nice place .
Staff was super helpful and enthusiastic .
Stayed here in October after running the Tough Mudder race in Coatsville .
"The room was spacious , quiet , clean , and well appointed ."
"Always clean , very helpful staff and right in downtown West Chester , close to everything ."
Limited parking on site but discount parking available near by .
"Lots of nice shops and restaurants , just walk out the front door ."
They tend to fill up fast so book early .
We have stayed at the Warner many times .
West Chester visit
"However , when we arrived and checked in we were greeted with a smile and a friendly hello ."
Nothing ...
"Our room was very clean , it contained 2 double beds which were comfortable and the bathroom was as it should be ."
Surprised
"We stayed here on the 6th of August , when i booked i was anxious due to some of the other reviews ."
Never Again
"The bathroom was newly finished , yet had BLACK MOLD on the walls ."
The furniture was old and broken .
"The rooms say no smoking , yet the bed spread and blanket had burn holes in them ."
"This Motel will be the last place in Washington , Pa I would ever stay again ."
"When I let them know at the front desk , they really ..."
Check in was horrible .
I specifically asked for a non smoking room .
I was very upset at this point .
Nor very friendly .
Not very polite at all .
So I stripped ...
The put me into a smoking room with a ash tray on the table in the room .
"There was burn holes , dog hairs on the bed spread ."
Traveling on business .
Worst Hotel I have ever experienced
America's Worst Value Inn
I appreciate the new carpet and counter and ...
"I hate writing reviews like this as a guy that owns a business , but you really should n't stay here ..."
"I knew going into this that i was getting a worker 's hotel , but I did n't expect the used condom left in the garbage in my room , or the window that did n't have locks ."
"Alright place , they are renovating rooms as they get empty ."
Denny's is right next door and other restaurants are close
"The place is kinda dated , but and kept - up ."
They are right off interstate at exit 15 .
worth the price
Dinner
Had a very good dinner took my husband for his birthday dinner.
had seafood raviolis and wings very good .
homecooked meals .
Nice bar very lovely bartender .
Breakfast ...
Paid extra for the jacuzzi tub and it did n't even work .
Staff repeatedly called priar to stay saying my room was n't going to be ready than saying nevermind when I called back .
The only good thing was breakfast!
The room is run down and dirty and the extra amenity paid for did n't work .
There was hair in the jacuzzi as well as the bath tub .
"Beds a little stiff , something slightly softer would have been great ."
Everyone was very nice and the value was good .
Everything was great .
"No bacon at breakfast , bacon at breakfast would be an improvement also ."
Very nice.
Courteous and helpful staff .
"It was a little pricey , but comparable to most hotels in the area ."
June Business Stay
The gym was very clean and all of the equipment was very well kept .
Very impressed by the cleanliness of the hotel .
Bachelor group stay
Breakfast is a ...
I wished the hotel provided with a shuttle service to local places .
My stayed at this hotel was great .
The rooms and pool was very clean .
The staff was very nice and help me in everything I needed .
This hotel is conveniently located and with many good restaurants to choose from .
Uber is a good second option .
And there was no weights or anything else .
I could not turn it off and it ran all night long .
"I did n't have time to get the staff to fix it , so I just covered the vents with clothes to keep it from blowing out so much ."
Out of control AC and breakfast was a joke.
The Breakfast was a joke .
"The pool was nice , but the work out center was a joke and only on of three tread mills worked ."
"The room was very clean , but the AC could not be controlled and we froze at night ."
There was only cereal and toast and that 's it .
"We did n't even eat it , we just went out on our way to our events ."
We were still cold .
good but ehh
it was ok I guess looks were deceiving
Horrible
HORRIBLE HORRIBLE
It 's will be my last time me in my family had the worse experience I 've ever had they lady at the desk was rude the maintenance guy whatever he was was rude in his hygiene was terrible also they kept pouring bleach in bleach in the pool while my kids was in it only when we was in the pool tho they could have waited the rooms are small very very small the tv was too my room looked like it was a run u just give away to Someone I hated everything about the days inn I DNT know how my reservations were there I wanted the comfort suite that was across the street from the days inn I want my money back asap that was a waste of time in money to be treated bad and poorly omg
Never book the days inn by the airport
All was good except the breakfast .
Decent for the price.
Left and went to Ihop !!!
No options at all .
Just a quick relief
Only thing needed was a hot tub in the pool room and the stay would have been excellent .
Rather then that hotel is in great location with access to express way and restaurants .
"Stay was great and staff was very nice , rooms where clean and had a great smell ."
FOR 60 !
"For 60 a night , we got a clean room with a concrete balcony , working television , breakfast , and there is even a pool ."
I do n't really understand why this hotel has such bad ratings .
Love this hotel
The only down ...
"The women at the front desk was extremely helpful and kind , and the hotel also works with an extremely reliable taxi service ."
"During breakfast they ran out of spoons , cereal was eaten with a fork ."
"Each day we had to ask for something that should have been in our room , towels , shampoo etc ."
I was given the address to Wal - mart to go and buy my own !
I wish management would train and hire additional employees for better customer service !
It is understaffed to say the least .
Never Again!!
Night desk clerk did not charge me for a roll away I needed for 1 night .
"Our last night there , we stood in a long line to ask for the cups that were not replaced during housekeeping ."
This is where the good news ends .
This was the most reasonably priced hotel .
55.00 including tax is reasonable .
Adequate for a night 's stay .
Close to shopping and restaurants .
Easy to find .
Found coupon at rest stop .
Old style analog TV .
Right off the interstate .
Rooms are clean but nothing fancy .
Staff friendly and helpful .
The property is older with some wear and tear .
You get what you pay for
A staff member yelled at me for doing this and said I was not ...
I decided against the breakfast and grabbed my cooler .
"Initially a was quite satisfied with this hotel until checkout time , I proceeded to the room containing the continental breakfast which was miniscule to say the least ."
Rude 1st shift staff
We needed ice for the the rest of the trip .
"Charles and Lee , the inn keepers , are gracious hosts and keep us well fed for the weekend ."
Great place to hold a large gathering
"We are a Men 's Fellowship group that meet once a year at the Cooper Hill Inn , we have always enjoyed a warm reception and good food for our group that can number up to 24 individuals ."
Just off I - 90 and Randall Rd. so it s easy to ...
Perfect getaway hotel
Perfect getaway hotel in great location !
Quiet surroundings which help get a good nights sleep .
The beds are comfortable to the point of wanting to know what mattresses they use .
Very nice comfortable guest room .
You have the choice of firm or soft pillows - at least in the room we had .
"But , most of all the quietness and friendliness of the employees ."
Very comfortable and relaxing ....
woo-hoo
Nice size rooms with wood floors to avoid any doggie odors .
Red Roof May
Very friendly well staffed .
"Great place , location , and I appreciate the coffee available in the lobby ."
I definately recommend!
Great
it was great
Highly recommend this hotel
"Hotel personnel called a cab twice , with a rapid response ."
I visited my old neighborhood for a few days .
The clerk recognized me from a previous stay when I checked in .
"The computer in the business center was n't working , so they printed my boarding pass at the front desk ."
A Pleasant Surprise
"If you are looking for nice accommodations and a friendly , family owned place that is clean , well located and moderately priced in a beautiful area of the North Fork of Long Island , then this may ..."
"If you are looking for the Ritz , keep looking ."
We stayed here for an entire week while attending a family reunion right down the road .
Good Place to Stay Close to the Highway
Perkin 's breakfast vouchers were a nice added bonus !
"Staff was very friendly , but fan in the bathroom did n't work and the beds were very firm ."
Could use a bit of a facelift but not critical .
Every thing was good .
Nice hotel
Pool looked nice but did not have time to use .
10 day road trip and this was one of the best .
"Clean , comfortable bed , nice pool and connected to Perkins where received a complementary breakfast ."
Due to Memorial Weekend they have the housekeeping staff off on that Monday !
Easy on and off I 94 .
I will stay here again!
Just traveling through and needed a place to sleep .
The only negative was we could hear other guest talking when we were in the bathroom and other noises from our room .
We could not have found a better place .
What a great gesture !
"Wonderful staff , what was left ."
Breakfast vouchers for attached Perkins restaurant were great !
Clean and Comfortable travel stop
Slept well .
This hotel worked out great .
Very clean and comfortable .
We needed an overnight stop for our travels from Minnesota to Illinois .
"clean room , the door could of used a some oil really noisy"
every was pleasent and helpful .
the room was really nice and clean
"Good, hotel, free breakfast but not the usua"
It was a good deal but disconcerting .
Seems like an older hotel but clean and comfortable with good service .
The kids got anything off the kids ' menu for free .
The one thing that threw us off was that we were expecting the usual breakfast buffet but instead received vouchers for a specific breakfast or 5 off any menu item at Perkins next door .
"clean room , the door could of used a some oil really noisy"
every was pleasent and helpful .
the room was really nice and clean
Exceptional service and hotel property!
Ken and Annie in Guest Services are personable and attentive to a traveler 's needs .
One of my favorite places to stay
The check in process is seamless .
The staff is extremely friendly and always great weary travelers with a smile .
It was comfortable and cozy and the decor is perfect !
Our family returned to Santa Fe this last week for a summer visit .
Our room was always extremely clean .
So happy to return!
We were happy to be treated again with the same warm hospitality as our previous visits to the Pecos Trail Inn .
The breakfast was ...
The little extras are appreciated
The room was clean and comfortable with 2 queen beds and easy access on the first floor .
This hotel is right off the highway and close to some decent restaurants .
We stopped here without a reservation on our way to Myrtle Beach .
When we arrived they had a cooler full of lemon ice water and fresh popcorn .
"Beds were comfy , pillows were too ."
Every .
From the moment we walked in we were treated like royalty !
Hotel is close to EVERYTHING .
If I had one complaint it would be that the air conditioning blew right on to the queen bed closest to it .
LOVED staying here
My husband fixed that by sitting a chair directly in front of it .
Rooms were spacious .
Single .
Thanks so much Bay Mont of Bowling Green for making the last half of our mini Vaca awesome !
"Time we came back from whatever we were doing , we were greater with hello and how are you !!!"
We did not eat breakfast there but I 'd recommend another hour onto that 9:00 cutoff )
We stayed here and drove the 25 miles to mammoth cave and it was well worth it .
You sure ca n't beat the 77 dollars a night for the service and cleanness of this hotel .
I heard very clearly the conversation the mother was having with her children in the next room .
I know this is an old building .
loud
The rooms are not sound proof .
"The shower did not get hot , warm enough , but not hot ."
Keep driving and do n't stop here .
Pool out of order .
"Room smelled musty , carpets and bedding had a sticky feel ."
Smelly room
Also awakened by loud talking in the hall and barking dogs in the morning .
I was directed to the rear entrance but was unable to use the key card to open the door .
Noisy and Indifferant
"Room was clean and nicely furnished but cheap , only ..."
This was evidently true for everyone as I heard loud banging on the door until I checked out .
"Good , nice pool has fridge , laundry Good"
Good clean place to stay a bit overpriced
Disappointed
I chose the hotel for the indoor pool .
I got a non-smoking room .
The indoor pool was closed .
"The room smelled of smoke , as did my clothes , later ."
customer
"I decided to check out before the next day after 11 and the lady at the front desk was very rude and said that "" SHE TOLD ME "" the check out time ."
I explained to her that she did not tell me the check out time and she would not refund my bill for the 2nd day .
I made a reservation for 2 nights and they neglected to tell me that the check out time was 11 am .
It was clean .
The hotel is in a good convenient area .
"Breakfast was great like at all the other ones we stayed in , the room was a great size and set up for our family ."
Great management!
I would highly recommend !
The manager did everything to make our stay as easy as possible .
Very accommodating !!
"Front desk very helpful , clean and good breakfast very easy to find just off I 95 Walking distance to restaurant and civic center Room was just what we needed after a long day of driving down I95 Very nice area in SC"
Just what we needed
Check in was a breeze and there were plentiful luggage carts to bring in our belongings .
Friendly and efficient
Pool and ...
Room was clean and spacious and breakfast was fully stocked by the two cheerful staff members who were present .
Staff suggested a parking location that made unloading a breeze .
This was the last stop on our marathon trip home from South Florida .
Holiday Inn Express at it's best
If you stay at Holiday Inn Express locations regularly you will be happy to find this property to be one of the good ones .
My pregnant wife enjoyed using the pool after 8 hours of driving .
Nothing about it feels overdue for updating or replacing .
We usually stay with Holiday Inn and occasionally are disappointed to find a poorly kept ...
Great Stopover
I reported it to ...
It was not attached properly to the wall .
"Rooms were clean , spacious and ready when we arrived ."
Staff were very friendly and professional at check in .
The area has some great places to eat and a very nice movie theatre next door .
When getting ready the next morning I did have problems with the hair dryer .
Eclectic Charm Outstanding Quality and service
"I booked a convention at the last minute and found the ALOFT incredibly affordable , almost 90 dollars less than the Hyatt and the Westin ."
"The room is large with an large shower and bath area , large desk for work ."
"The staff was incredibly nice and inviting , The ALOFT ..."
This is a new hotel and is in impeccable condition .
Excellent hospitality from check in to check out .
Genuine hospitality will bring us back.
Great value .
Price includes drinks and light supper which was very child friendly and hot / cold breakfast that will bring us back
I was impressed with the breakfast the hotel offers .
It 's beautiful and brand new .
It had more than the usual selection of breakfast foods .
NICE NEW HOTEL IN BUTTE
The Holiday Inn in Butte is a great new addition to the City .
The hotel is right off of the interestate and is close to nearly everything in town .
There was n't much for vegan and vegetarian ...
Convenient Location
On this trip we stayed here on October 20th and again on our trip home on November 3rd .
"This was our second stay at this motel , our other one being the previous October ."
"While I can agree with some previous comments about the upgrade as far as the comfort of the bed , the fourth floor renovations resulted in downsizing of ..."
Great
"They are pet friendly , have nice clean rooms , the staff is wonderful and the breakfast is Great ."
This was our first time staying at a LaQuinta and it wo n't be our last .
"We travel across the United States twice a year from Florida to BC , Canada and we will be staying at LaQuinta more ."
Another Great Visit
"Clay , Amyjo and Christina for always taking care of my needs ."
Great views of the mountains and the town from the rooms .
Hotel is the tops in Butte .
I will be visiting again thanks to you
Thank you for always having clean amenities .
"Thank you Kayla ,"
"The bedroom is very clean , the bed is very comfortable ."
"Breakfast was decent as far as hotel breakfasts go , and internet speed was better than average for a hotel as well ."
"Clean , newly remodeled hotel ."
Great Hotel
"If you have to spend two weeks in a hotel , There are worse places to do so ."
"Quiet rooms , and a helpful staff ."
the room dcor was more than a bit ...
this hotel is a little out of the way and a little tricky to get to even though you can plainly see it from the highway .
this La Quinta is a little different
we were on our way home and had a long day on the road and decided to stay in butte rather than go on to Bozeman .
A great stopping point
"The only problem was a lack of internet WI - FI , due to a glitch in the equipment ."
"The physical accommodations were very good , the bed was very comfortable , and the service was good ."
"We travel this route on a regular basis , and we will definitely stay here again ."
"We were very please with the La Quinta Butte , MT ."
Quiet
"The hotel was clean , beds were comfy , and everyone was super polite ."
"We loved this hotel , it was a little further away from the hustle and bustle of the quarter which was perfect for us ."
We was in town for the football game so it was right in our budget for a quick overnight stay .
Great Bloody Mary's
My hubby and I first stopped here on July 28 and this is our 3rd time back since .
Obviously .
They have just recently started to serve breakfast and it was very good .
We love the bloody Mary 's and the food has been great every time .
We will be back ...
Clean with friendly servers .
Hubby and I stopped for lunch on a Saturday .
I had a Rachel and hubby had roast beef sandwich .
Lunch stop
People in and out while we were there getting food to go .
Real turkey breast on Rachel and bread ...
Simple menu with something for everyone .
Very cool bar and atmosphere .
We also ordered a basket of fries .
"Comfy beds , nice kitchenette ...."
Great for family travel .
Helpful staff .
I was traveling with 3 teens so the two room suite with 2 queen beds really helped .
Lancaster was a bit out of the way but it worked fine for a late night and early morning .
Nice brief stay!
Rooms were very nice .
This was a great stopover on our way to LA .
The room had a odor.
"the staff was very friendly , but the room smelled musty and the carpet felt dirty ."
( I use a wheelchair so this was an unreasonable option ! )
"As a matter of fact , I did n't ."
"For a customer with balance issues , this makes it hard to toilet independently ."
"He finally contacted a supervisor , who ok 'd staying in the accessible room with my dog ."
"He offered me a pet friendly room , but it was not accessible ."
I would be happy to consult with you to ensure that rooms are made accessible !
"In the bathroom , the toilet sat on the middle of the wall , nothing as far as grab bars ."
It was frustrating that the room is considered to be accessible !
It was nearly impossible to maneuver past the bed .
Not Heather Accessible
The guest service informed me that my service dog would not be able to stay in the handicap accessible room with me .
"Upon entering the room , the room was very tight ."
Breakfast was adequate .
Coffee was good .
It was very clean and very comfortable .
Nice Hotel
"The hotel , considering the room rate and proximity to ammenities , and cleanliness , it can not be beat ."
There was an onsite computer for guest use .
We stayed in a newly renovated room .
WiFi was free .
Looks brand new .
New clean hotel in the Soco District.
Rooms were spacious and super clean .
Very close to the Soco District and St Edward 's University which was convenient since we were there to visit the school .
Great hotel that needs shuttle service
"However , the only problem was that I was told when I booked it that it had a free shuttle ."
I would stay here again .
"There was no shuttle , so this added some extra cost and planning ."
"This hotel was great overall -- clean , decent sized rooms , and good breakfast ."
We were counting on using this to get to and from ACL .
"Close , with a Huge Room and Great Staff , KK Donuts in the Hotel Parking Lot , Good Pool and Great Breakfast as Well !"
Memorial Day!
Went to the Memorial Day Celebration at the Texas State Cemetery like we do every year !!
"After a long hard day of work , a hot shower and cable is not expecting too much ."
"He said all of Albert Lea did n't have cable , and hot water always works ... you just need to pull really hard on the faucet ( which I did ) ."
My advice DO N'T DO IT !!
"No apologies , just stated we already offer the lowest price rate , and I ca n't do anything about it I thought I would take a chance since I was there for 1 night after reading reviews ."
"No cable , no hot water ."
"No Hot Water, No Cable"
Reported to staff / manager
"Across the road the hotel had many guests for that night ... tells you something , does it not ."
Also our room had a noisy fan and the heat was hard to control
Room condition
We were the only people staying that night .
Every time you moved you sounded like an old metal desk .
Ok if you just need to sleep a few hours
The beds are on metal boxes .
"The hotel smelled funny , there was no elevator , there was no bar or chain on the door and it was hard to lock ."
Never again Motel 6!!!
"No desk , no chair , no in - room coffee service , and no place to sit and relax outside ."
Other chains have provided us far more comfort at the same price .
The bed squeaked with every move and it was the only piece of furniture to sit on .
The ceiling above us squeaked as well .
The entry door keypad was completely busted and the parking lot was deteriorating badly .
The room was sparsely furnished and not clean .
There was a bunch of hair behind the bathroom door where staff had not cleaned the bathroom properly .
This hotel did not meet my expectations .
"Bathroom was clean and shower was hot so if that 's what you are looking for , you will be satisfied ."
Do n't expect anything other than a fairly decent place to sleep .
"Having said all that , the room was clean and bed was pretty comfortable ."
"In the morning when we checked out , the coffee pots were still empty ."
No frills
There is no tissue ( Kleenex ) and do n't expect complimentary shampoo and conditioner .
We asked for another pillow and were told one would be sent to the room .
We never got it .
"When we checked in , the two coffee pots were empty ."
I would stay there again
Needed a quiet place to spend the night during a cross country trip .
This is all I look for in a hotel .
This was in a quiet location and there was no noise heard from adjoining rooms .
Wifi worked well and I got a good nights sleep .
Would stay there again .
Best Deep Dish Pizza
"Peoria , Il has to offer.view less"
"The atmosphere is great , the servers were cutious and very nice people , and the pizza was killer ."
"The food was excellant , very well garnished and flaverfull , and I can not remember having deep ... view moredish pizza that great !"
"The manager came out and asked us how we were , this is always a good sign of a well ran restaurant ."
"The waitress took very good care of us , and yes at the time there was not alot of business due to snowfall that day , she did stop to have a conversation with us ."
Uno 's is one of the best restaurants
We visited Uno 's this past winter .
Decided to stay at this hotel for convenience of walking to Cat Visitors Center and to the riverfront .
My first thought when I walked into the front desk area was that this hotel appears to be a nice quit place to relax .
Night in Moline
Received a little attitude from the front desk person when checking into the hotel when I asked a ...
Breakfast was hot and delicious .
Close to ...
Great remodel
I stayed at the Mark Twain last week for business and was impressed .
The bar tenders were very accommodating .
The drink and breakfast coupons were awesome .
The front desk was friendly and helpful .
The rooms were clean and well decorated .
There were buffet offerings as well as made to order waffles and omlets .
Great place
It 's a few blocks from the Illinois River with restaurants and the Spirit of Peoria riverboat .
"The bar had great entertainment too ...... , ...................."
The staff was so nice and breakfast was wonderful .
"This hotel has a historic , mixed with modern ambiance ."
First time staying at a Red Roof Inn .
Good room great value
I travel extensively for work and I got a good room at a great price .
I will definitely be looking for them in the future .
My room was clean and comfortable .
"The staff was great , especially Lynnae ."
They were very accommodating .
A bit noisy with the train but did n't bother us .
Breakfast is not even worth mentioning .
Lowest cost in DeKalb
Our biggest issue was that I called a week ahead to make sure the pool would be open which was the only reason we picked this hotel and was told yes it would be opened .
The rooms are nice .
We got there and went ...
Food was good especially for dinner .
Great deal!
"No frills room , clean ."
Not high priced .
The real seller for us was the hot dinner with free drinks .
Then a hot breakfast also free .
We would definitely stay here again .
Everything went as planned .
Nice free breakfast .
"Shower had nice pressure , and the beds were firm but not hard ."
Smooth (mostly)
"The free WiFi was a bit slow , the TV / Cable had some quirks but was manageable ( no HD ) ."
The pool was bath temperature ( Very Warm ! ) .
We had a problem one night with the lock on the bathroom door and the folks at the front desk were helpful .
"Despite the ongoing stucco and paint work outside , it ..."
My return stay here was as good as the first and still better than the other main hotel in town .
Return stay to the best in Woodstock..
"Solid customer service with clean , comforatble , and quiet rooms is what I look for while on the road and I found it here again here ."
The value is also spot on .
A pleasant surprise!
Ca n't beat the price and get all that anywhere else .
Free breakfast was excellent .
Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful .
Hotel was very clean and updated .
I do n't know why this was rated at a 2 !!
If you want a 5 star hotel then book a five star hotel !
Made it that much more homey .
Only downside was beds were n't the greatest .
Pool was nice .
Room was great .
Was a small hotel which was fine for us .
We picked the room here because it was central to some places we were going on vacation .
We stayed here end of July 2015 .
Would definatly recommend staying here .
A single night stay
"Overall , a good stay ."
The breakfast was very tasty and the fella who was stocking was very attentive and helpful .
The staff were friendly and the room was clean - though a bit dated and in need of some service ( a lamp was burned out ) .
We stayed one night after a full day of touring and driving .
Great Ambiance
"However , ..."
Our room was attractive but smallish .
"The huge lobby has a giant fireplace , a billiards table , and a full bar , where guests were hanging out and socializing ."
"The only hassle was that they charged for the breakfast on a per-item basis , which was mediocre quality and expensive ."
"This is an upscale , modern hotel with the camaraderie of a hostel ."
"The location is good , and there is a restaurant around the corner ."
"The room was spacious , and clean , and the bed comfortable ."
"The staff is friendly , and very competent ."
This hotel is super !!
Very convenient
Very quiet .
"All in all , I would definitely stay here ..."
"Great Deal, Great place to stay!"
Stayed there just for a weekend trip for a wedding and was pleasantly surprised by how nice the hotel was for the price !
The breakfast in the morning was good for a hotel and for being included with plenty of options to choose from .
"The rooms were very clean , the beds comfortable ."
My wife was told it is in your room !
No free breakfast!
"To our dismay , it was not included and does not even offer free coffee in the lounge ."
We checked in on April 29- 30 2016 and were looking to enjoy a free breakfast as listed on the website for this property .
"We stayed at the Fairfield Inn in Matthews , NC two days ..."
I was just a little disappointed that the local channels would not come through on the tv .
I was told a maintenance technician would be up to assist and no one ever showed .
It was great .
"Nice room, minus the cable service"
Alpine Inn
Carpet was a bit worn .
Overall the place was clean and a bargain for the price .
The breakfast was so so .
The rooms need updating .
The staff was terrific .
We would stay there again if in the area .
You get what you pay for .
Affordable
Brought my bicycle into the room overnight after I drove over to the Rock River and road the trail there for a few miles .
Fast / easy breakfast items coffee in the morning .
"On my way out east , the perfect distance to travel for the day ."
Had a great time at magic waters .
One lady on 3rd shift was AWESOME .
pit stop to the water park
"Rooms where OK , bed and pillows sucked ."
So glad i got the splash and stay package .
something could be done to the room to make it feel ...
The lady that checked us in seemed like she did n't know much about the hotel or anything in the area .
"Everything about this place was 1st class ... good check - in with Toni , nice ..."
Nice and new
We have driven by this property several times on our way to and from the Gulf Coast ... even watched it get built .
We were coming back from FloraBama with our 3 year old granddaughter and decided to splurge a little and take advantage of this Hotel and it 's indoor / outdoor pool .
All the wonderful extras including the food and friendly staff make it possible to stay in your entire stay if you choose to .
Drury Plaza
Everything you need
"Hotel in Franklin , TN provides you with everything you need for a stay away from home ."
"It 's comfortable , clean and cozy in the rooms and suites ."
It 's everything you need and more .
I travel alot on business and go back to the same places often and have a hotel that I think is good so stick with it .
Last review says it best...STAY HERE
The hotel ...
"Well this time I went on trip advisor first , so this hotel was 1 and decided to give it a try ."
What can i say but it was a totally different experience .
"Close to downtown Franklin , 20 minutes to downtown Nashville ."
"Great Staff, Great Stay..."
"Our stay at their location in Findlay , Ohio was equal to this ."
Staff does a very nice job .
The second location I have stayed at and both experiences have been great .
Very quiet and comfortable .
Ca n't say enough about our stay at this Drury .
Fantastic !
"It was in a very convenient location to local attractions , shopping , and restaurants ( one attached to the hotel ) ."
The staff was helpful and cheerful and the place was spotless .
Very happy to see this chain expanding to new areas of the country .
All the staff is fantastic .
Great Service
I 'll certainly stay here again .
Teri and Charlie during Kickback are especially fantastic and help to make your stay fun .
The amenities are really nice .
"The bathrooms are nice , and have the best showers of any hotel I have ever stayed at ."
This hotel is great !
"Breakfast here is 10 Thank you for your feedback , we do offer a Hilton Honors program , you are awarded points for each stay that offers great perks throughout the year , please consider signing up ."
Considering how much they charge you 'd think they at least would offer a continental breakfast .
Nice but overpriced
While this is a very nice hotel I ca n't say that it is better than others in the area charging a lower price .
"Basic, very basic"
"Free breakfast , free snoring nose strips !"
It 's convenient and that 's about it .
"One window , opens to walkway , no cross ventilation ."
Go somewhere else
I 'm so glad we only had to spend one night here .
Instead it just gets wadded up when you sleep .
The bed was really uncomfortable .
The breakfast buffet was pitiful .
The coverlet on to of the bed was worn and pilled and you do n't even want to sit on it .
The room had an odd smell .
They put a thick pad on top of the mattress I guess to make it better .
This place is old and dated .
Breakfast was .... a joke .
I could n't wait to get out of there .
I slept all of 2 hours the whole night as I felt like there were bugs crawling on me in the bed .
Never again....
Spend the extra and stay at a better hotel .
The rooms were old and beat up .
You get what you pay for .
Breakfast is tasty .
Clean and Spacious
Clean room and great air ...
Convenient walk to great restaurants and wine tasting rooms .
Cookies at 7 pm .
The person at the desk was very helpful .
"The room is spacious , well arranged , and comfortable ."
We spent several days here as a rest stop on a long bicycle tour .
We were checked in well before the standard check - in time .
"For its price point , Best Western Walla Walla is really pretty awesome ."
Frankly Pretty Awesome
"It 's a short walk to downtown , the rooms have an upscale decor and are very comfortable and clean , the beds are excellent , the front desk is helpful , and the free breakfast is not bad at all ( decent selection by current standards -- which are admittedly not very high ..."
"A little on the high side compared to similar places we 've stayed , but still reasonable ."
"However , no coffeemaker ."
Like an old fashioned motor court
No ice machine either .
Park right in front of your door !
"Rooms have flat screen , wifi , micro , fridge ."
Do not recommend
"Expectation for a motel are naturally low , and this fits below average for a motel ."
Not worth your money or time .
The management was disappointing at best .
The motel is poorly managed and maintained .
The smoking rooms reek of smoke and the non-smoking rooms are not much better .
Business Trip
What I Expected
Jacuzzi was nice .
room 118 beware
The air I on 60 degrees and it never got cold in the room before it would cut off for very long periods of time .
The bathtub leaked .
The sink kept backing up .
There were gnats flying around i think because of the clogged drain .
Went in the pool night before we left broke out the next day all over .
won't again
Nice hotel
The only complaint that I have was that you could n't close the thicker curtain so no light came through ..
We had a post light from outside shine through our window all night making it hard to sleep
"Rooms are spacious and clean , furniture is modern ."
Stayed at this property to avoid staying in New Jersey .
"Very clean property , with three floors , elevator , pool , hot tub ."
Very Pleased
"Very pleased with the property , about 5 miles off I 95 , but there are two good places to eat within walking distance ."
"Very quiet , staff was very pleasant and helpful , breakfast area ..."
"All remember me , even housekeeping .."
I always feel welcome there ..
I am greeted like a friend ..
I have spent many visits at this hotel ..
I will return anytime ...
The breakfast is always hot and ready for anyone .. there is always someone at the front desk for your every need ..
The rooms are spacious and always clean ..
The staff is very friendly and helpful ..
WILLRETURN
"I was extremely disappointed in the customer service I received from the wait staff for breakfast , it was the managers wife which is even worse , she was very rude and nasty , it was the way that she told us that we had to have shoes on our feet to be in the breakfast area which it was not posted anywhere , ..."
rude customer service
carpets are a problem
"If it was n't for the carpets , this would have been a decent place to stay carpets are chemically sprayed on and it adds an irritating smell to the room - watch out for people with respiratory issues ."
"Location is not that great , but it 's an ok stop on the road with some restaurants within walking distance"
"Otherwise , staff was helpful and friendly ."
As with many of my other reviews my love of the best western chain was once again confirmed with this property .
Great Place To Stay
"The staff was welcoming and friendly , and the property and rooms were very clean throughout ."
These things make a huge difference anytime you travel but especially when you travel for weeks at a time .
This Hotel and it 's staff ...
"I had a soccer team from the Olympic Develoment Program spend the weekend there early March , they were very accommodating very helpful and ..."
It is the closest hotel .
More importantly it is a very nice hotel and the service ca n't be beat .
Near Kirkwood Soccer Complex
This is the place to stay if you are participating in an event at the Kirkwood Soccer Complex .
Good rooms and friendly service .
Great stay
Housekeeping was wonderful .
Ms. Dawn was one nice lady .
PERFECT .
Rooms were clean and front desk was very peasant .
she did n't hesitate to bring us some .
The ...
The stay was wonderful .
when I told her another girl did n't bring any towels and was over two hours ago .
When she cleaned the room she never forgot anything .
"My husband asked if we could be moved into another room the next day , we knew they were fully booked , and the front desk man told us all the beds are the same and they never got complaints about the beds ."
"Our first night was awful , the bed was very uncomfortable ."
Overall nice hotel.
VERY RUDE .
We stayed 3 nights .
Well the next ...
If I would had stayed Friday night also the rate would had been 216.00 .
It just was n't worth that kind of money for the quality .
Not worth the money.
The first night I stayed here it was on a Thursday night .
The front desk staff was very nice and ...
The rate was around 166.00 .
This hotel is only about a 100.00 per night hotel .
Cheap Place to Crash But Don't Look Closely
Dirt in corners of room and windows .
"Dirty floors , minimal cable TV , no amenities other than free WiFi ( worked fine ) and free parking ."
Everything has been used well ( which is not a Positive statement ) .
This property definitely needs renovation .
It is well worth the money to stay here .
My husband and I stayed just one night but would not hesitate to stay here again when we need a place in this location .
Renovated and very nice
Save money by staying ...
"This hotel is extremely reasonable , well located and very recently remodeled ."
You certainly would n't expect the updated look in a place this modest .
Blue Springs State Park is about fifteen minutes away and the main highway is also close .
I recomend this hotel .

"We spent 4 glorious days at this resort in Deland , for a family reunion ."
Highly recommend this little Gem!
My fiance I went to visit friends living year round at Riviera Resort Marina .
The room was everything we needed plus more .
Two beds and a full kitchen for a really great price .
We even had a partial water view .
We fished the St. Johns River Lake Beresford and caught ...
We stayed 3 nights in room 113 .
I am particular about cleanliness and service but found this hotel satisfying in all areas .
Impressive
Just steps away from the soft sand beach .
The pool is great .
The staff are professional and friendly .
This hotel is a great place for a relaxing family getaway .
Another Amazing Stay at this beautiful Holiday Inn Resort!
I had stayed at this property a year ago and loved it so much that I decided to bring my girlfriend with me on this trip for some relaxation .
We arrived Dec 3rd and were greeted by the awesome frontdesk staff .
We had the most amazing stay at this beautiful property .
We were upgraded to ...
Where do I Start !!! :)
"A couple of months ago , I called to inquire about a stay and had experienced poor customer service ."
"At that time , I wrote it off as perhaps the representative was having a bad day ...."
AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES
This morning I called to inquire about the availability for a five night stay wanting to give this property another chance from a previous unpleasant experience .
Definitely will be returning during warmer weather !
Every staff encountered was friendly and spoke .
Impeccable!
"Not only lobby , but pictures in room were dusted and clean !"
"Only ate breakfast in the restaurant , but everything was great ."
This hotel was probably the cleanest I 've ever seen .
Great hotel and exceptional service
I spend a lot of my life in hotels and I can say I hardly ever review them .
Ivana made the rental process easy and painless .
"The service at this location , is so great though it is hard to not say anything ."
Then there was ...
We recently had our meeting at this location and they took great care of us .
Martisha at the front desk made a first impression that never wavered .
OH MY !
PLEASANT SURPRISE!!
Rooms were quiet at night .
Staff goes out of their way to be friendly .
The beds were comfortable .
The food from the grill by the pool was DELICIOUS !
This quickly became ...
"We had no idea what to expect , but when we arrived , we were BLOWN away ."
It is truly one of our favorite activities .
"Russ is so helpful , knowledgeable and relaxed that we all ca n't wait to see him ."
Scalloping with Capt. Russ is our families favorite activity!
Scalloping with native sun tours is a ...
We always get our scallop limit .
We have gone scalloping with Capt Russ for the past four summers .
We have sent many groups his way and everyone feels the same .
A nice refuge from the big hotels now under construction every where in Clearwater .
"Excellent small hotel , nicely decorated , our room overlooked the marina which was not busy during a cold snap ."
Excellent Small Hotel With Marina
Front desk was welcoming and ready to help .
Nice harbor view .
"Room was large , clean and quiet ."
TV should be updated but gave a clear picture .
Been visiting for about twenty years ....
"Birthday 's , Anniversaries , Guys weekends and family visits all have been celebrated at the Chart House ."
It all started with my girlfriend and I first visiting there in the mid- nineties and now we take our children and our dog with us .
"The views are some of the best , balconies are huge and definitely used ."
We just loved all the boats ...
A bit outside Clearwater but some nice restaurants close by .
Definitely a good place to stay if you have access to a car .
Free parking .
Nice little hotel by a small marina
Nice rooms and inexpensive .
No reception staff after 7 PM but they will leave you a key to your room .

Check in was quick and our room was ready early which was a treat .
Everyone was friendly and helpful ....
Great basic hotel
It 's a quick walk to the action but lovely and serene .
Location is fabulous .
Room was bright and came as advertised .
"Traffic in Clearwater was frenetic getting here , but when we turn onto the street it was like a peaceful oasis ."
If you 're a history buff you 'll love this place !
It was a wonderful romantic weekend !
Just remember ...
My husband and I love Behind the Fence !
Serene Getaway
"The inn keepers Carolyn Larry are delightful , they made us feel right at home !"
The lagoon style pool is divine especially under the stars .
This time we stayed in the Red Shutter Room ( cabin ) .
Claude had taken my reservation a few weeks before .
Fabulous Iconic Palm Beach Gem!
He was delightful and Victoria was just as helpful at check - in .
I had an event to attend in Palm Beach and did not want to have to drive home late that evening .
It was the perfect opportunity to stay at The Colony .
The decor and rooms are just what one might ...
Bathrooms are small and need exhaust fans / Decorating looks like the 1980 's florals came alive .
Beautiful area with nice restaurants
Do n't stay join the 2nd floor by the street .
Palm Beach
Staff is great though and location is great if you do n't have a car .
Walking distance to town and beach .
Way too noisy .
Great Service
I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a spot in the middle of the town .
Rooms have been recently redecorated and are really comfortable .
Staff was friendly and location was terrific .
Visited recently and had a lovely experience .

"The staff was very friendly , the place was clean and orderly ."
This is a very nice hotel in a small town .
"Very clean , new and up to date ."
Very Nice Place
"Dirty , old soap on floor of shower , real thin 2 towels , only 1 / 2 roll TP , bed real soft lumpy , no water glass , smelled moldy , the AC Was so noisy whenever it decided to cycle would wake up Rip VanWinkle ."
I looked for Cheep and I got it .
just better than sleeping in your car if it's raining
as pictured
"Our room , which is the one pictured on their site ( 201 ) ..."
"They said the interiors ( not the exteriors ) were newly renovated , and that seems to be the case ."
"We were referred here after the Comfort Inn , which is apparently owned by the same family , recommended it when they were unable to renew our room there because they were sold out ."
"Breakfast was fine - muffins , bagels pastries , toast , hard boiled eggs , juices cereals etc ."
It IS a Red Roof Plus.
"The staff are very helpful and friendly and the rooms , large , clean and well appointed ."
Very good price point .
We had nice linens too .
We have stayed in too many Red Roof hotels to mention and this one definitely ranks as one of the best ones ...
Bed was way to soft .
Nice little hotel.
one night stay
"So we got this place cause it was cheapest in the area , and ended up being almost better than the room we had just stayed in for a week ."
The bathroom was newly redone and very nice .

It had everything we needed plus a mini-fridge and an lcd tv .
Me and my husband decided to get away for a weekend and found this hotel online .
The room was clean and comfortable .
Very Nice for the Price!
Decent budget hotel
I called the night before and was told that I could check in any time .
I needed a room for a couple of hours to prep for an event .
What was n't said was that I could check in IF there was a room available .
When I showed up at 10 am I was told that no one had checked out yet ....
Customer service was great as well .
"Location is good , next to steak house Starbucks plus right off 15 Fwy ."

The price is great and a good place to stay .
We were very pleased with how clean this Super 8 was .
We will be back .
After about he 5th time he ...
He kept telling me that the TV was OK but I still could not change the channels .
Man that helped me with problem with the TV did not speak English very well n I had to tell him several times that I did not understand him .
Review
The lady at front desk was very friendly .
"I appreciated the safety of his intentions but , I do n't believe I ever signed up for that part of him being a manager ."
Joseph ( male maid ) likes to go into peoples rooms while they ...
Rafael ( manager ) likes to look into peoples windows even with the blinds closed to see what you are up to while you are in your room .
stay away from this place
I slept on top of the covers because I was scared to get under them ..
just let me do it this way * hard bed * flat pillow * room smelled HORRIBLE * CARPET WAS DIRTY * toilet would n't flush * room was horrible * room was horrible *...
Stayed here overnight during thanksgiving .. I would have rather slept OUTSIDE ! !!!
Worst Stay Of my life!!
Excellent location very convienient
Our room was small but very nicely done ...
Parking in the ferry terminal lot is easy and close but costs extra and it paid to the hotel .

We spent a night there while visiting our daughter .
Hope to Come Back to this Beautiful Hotel
It actually was a very pleasant surprise !!
Our room was beautiful and very spacious with a comfortable sitting area .

Wonderful Small Boutique Hotel with Great Views of San Francisco Bay
"There are times when I grouse about how much a room might cost because all I 'm doing is sleeping there , but there are times when you are staying in a resort area where you may use your room a lot more ."
"This is an older hotel , on the historic downtown waterfront , and yes , the rooms are small , but it was ..."
Tidy Downtown Room
"I lived in the East Bay before , and never thought much about it assumed there were the usual hotels galore found in ..."
Lovely Victorian Ambience with Golden Rooms
"There are not a lot of hotels in Sausalito , which surprised me ."

Would stay again !
Clean comfy but loud freeway
Our door had an obvious gap between the frame and the ...
The hotel had a 70's vibe but has been updated .
The hotel is a stones throw from the I - 5 fwy and you can hear the traffic and see it from the door .
The room was clean and comfortable and plenty of space .
We liked the room decor and bed .
"That said , the location just north of Los Angeles on i - 5 makes it very convenient ."
The breakfast room was large enough and offered a ...
The layout of the buildings make for a quiet rest .
"This is an older facility and there are little things in the rooms that need to be handled carefully , such a towel bars and electrical outlets ."
Will recommend
"A five cent earplug , and you drop 170 a night to listen to a roaring freeway ."
The Noise
Then give earplugs within the room with a complimentary note .
Will not stay again as they place pet friendly rooms along freeway section that has no sound wall barrier .
First the location .
I figured I 'd give this one a try since it mentioned it was recently remodeled .
"It was our first time staying at this motel , we usually stay elsewhere but many of the hotels were booked because of New Years Eve ."

"This place was cheapest and I have to say , it was brilliant ."

Breakfast ...
Decent Hotel
I do not understand that .
Thankfully the A / C in the rooms worked .
The hotel was very very clean with up to date interior furnishings and bedding .
The reason there are only 4 stars is because there are no refrigerators / microwaves in the rooms and the hallways were very hot .
The room was clean and the bed was comfortable .
"Although the room was a bit small , there was a gift bag of refreshments and water awaiting me in my room as well as lemon infused ice water all day in the lobby and fresh flowers in ..."
I was met by the most welcoming and friendly attendant I have ever encountered at the front desk for an easy check in .
wonderful stay!
"I stayed 2 nights , a Wednesday and a Thursday ."
Nice Place If You Don't Like Sleeping
The noise from the hall sounded like a frat house with revelers coursing through ...
The room was dark with insufficient electric lighting .
The room was pretty clean .
There was a safe in the room that did n't work .
This hotel gave me Room 232 next to the ice machine and the elevator .

We have stayed here twice due to work in the area and needed a safe secure place to park our work vehicle .
"Bedrooms were tiny , as was the ensuite bathroom ."
Fabulous location for visiting the college
"The breakfast room is adequate and the breakfast was bare - boned ( 1 type of bread , 2 types of muffins , apple , oatmeal , yoghurt , granola ) but fresh , and self - serve ."
"The hotel is older , but ..."
The hotel reminded me of a boarding house .
"There is no elevator for the hotel , so it wo n't accommodate handicapped guests ."
Barely Acceptable
It 's pretty obvious the owner is letting this place run down while he collects exorbitant rates ( weekends ) for a room .
It also showed signs of lone term neglect .
My room was clean and very spacious .
The included breakfast has to be the worst I have encountered - if all you want is a glass of orange juice they can handle ...
Definitely great for the price and I would stay here again !
"I just needed a place to sleep for a night and with no child this time , I have few needs ."
No Complaints!

The staff ( especially Chris at the front desk ) with restaurant recommendations and a local florist that delivered flowers that the hotel made sure where in the room when we arrived .
We will definitely be back .
What a wonderful stay .

"We have been coming to the SeaCrest for about 35 years , and now our children and grandchildren are following the tradition ."
Check in people not very friendly .
Cracks in stairs and rusty door opening .
Dark rooms because only sliding glass door for sunlight and plantation shutters needed to be propped open ( I ised water bottles ) .
Dark rooms despite ocean view
Liked kitchenette
No other Windows !

Went for a couple of nights with my wife and our 3 kids and all of us came back home with wonderful memories .
After a long drive we arrived to a great welcome friendly staff and free coffee !!
Breakfast was lush could eat as much as you want and my partner ate about 4 helpings of different things !!

Great time .
I would definitely recommend to friends and family and return .
Mini vacation
"The front staff as awesome and accommodating , the room they put my family in was perfect ."
They also have bbq grills where you can bring your own food and use .
Very close to everything .
A little odd for us was the lack of a bar and room service only for drinks ....
Ocean views and easy walk to town along sandy beach
Think we saw more whales feeding from the pool area than on the boat trip from Monterrey .
"We stayed here as part of our road trip and found it to have nice rooms and views , both from the pool area and room balcony ."
Beautifully redone property .
"Breakfast included in the lobby and it was perfect , not too much , very clean and not yucky as most included breakfast can be and we got to eat it overlooking the beach ..."
"Great location , close to everything and convenient ."
Perfect Family Getaway
Visited for Thanksgiving weekend with a few families to getaway and do some wine tasting by the beach !
"Beautiful views , huge pool and jacuzzi ."
Celebrated our 32nd anniversary .
Great staff .
May return for our 33rd
Romantic getaway
And the view of the Ocean was fantastic .
I 'll be back
PCH Road Trip
"Really great hotel , good breakfast buffet and I loved the fact they had a stairway going down to the beach area ..."
The only unfortunate thing was the weather was n't in our favor to enjoy the hot tub and fire pits .
From the first greeting to every contact with staff the customer service is excellent .
"It 's rare that we ever stay in an independent hotel , but that 's mostly what you find in Pismo Beach ."
Staff has great pride in their facility and work
The hotel has obviously been remodeled and the decor and rooms are very competitive to a Marriott Courtyard .
The location is great and hotel has a stairway ...
Although we only spent one night at the hotel it was very pleasant with our ground floor room opening onto the rear garden that lead down to the beach .
Pleasant one night stay
The beach was lovely with good ...
We recently stayed one night at the SeacCrest Oceanfront Hotel on our way down the coast after driving the Big Sur and visiting Hearst Castle .
10 min walk down the beautiful beach to all the restaurants and a little town .
Beautiful spot
Breakfast is brilliant selection for a continental breakfast that 's included .
Group of 4 young adults travelling through california we stayed here for 2 nights .
Room was upgraded on arrival for free as it was my birthday .
Two huge hot tubs that are beautiful to sit ...
Best Hotel in Pismo
"If you want a stunning ocean front view , friendly staff , beautiful ground , and pampering rooms , SeaCrest Ocean Front Hotel is the place to be !!!!"
The room was spotless and not one thing was ...
We have been coming to SeaCrest for years but this latest stay really topped it all .
We were given a spa deluxe room with a fantastic view !!
Beautiful sunsets .
Downtown and the pier are walking distance from Seacrest along the beach .
It would be nice ...
No need to go anywhere .
Peaceful paradise
The beach feels like a private beach .
The location feels like a small paradise .
The views are breathtaking .
"While there are a lot of stairs down to the beach , they are real stairs built and provided by Seacrest ."
"3rd Floor , Ocean"
Overall this was a great experience and I would definitely stay here again .
They gave us a free breakfast down the road and they let us check out a little later .
Very Romantic
"View , Deluxe room made great memories with my significant other ."
Beautiful room with a view
"It appears sll rooms have a view of the ocean , but the 4 storey block ..."
The staff were helpful and breakfast on the verandah overlooking the ocean was great .
We were very happy with the well appointed room with a beautiful view .
With no great expectations we stayed at Sea Crest as a stop over on our way to LAX .
Booked a pet friendly room on 2 different nights .
Came here this past week with the kids and dog .
If your pet is more than 20 lbs the bed will probably be too small .
Pet friendly....kind of
There is a 25.00 extra charge per ...
There was a nice small dog bed and dishes in the closet for you to use during your stay .
My husband and I had a relaxing time .
Our room was overlooking the ocean .
Relaxing Interlude
The hotel is close to downtown so you have access to shops and restaurants .
The room was spotless and the staff is very cordial and accommodating .
We will definitely return to SeaCrest !
"Excellent continental breakfast , excellent restaurant advice ."
"Friendly staff , beautiful room , great views ."
"My wife decided we should stay in Pismo Beach , and this hotel was right on the water , and was completely great ."
Really nice hotel right on the beach.
We were delighted .
Best ...
Had a really lovely time at Seacrest oceanfront .
Met all expectations and more
The breakfast was good - the afternoon cookies enjoyed and the staff very helpful .
The little extras added to the experience .
We were n't overly happy with the first oceanfront room as the balcony was small and restricted the view so we were delighted to be moved to a ground floor room .
Fianc birthday
The breakfast in the morning was great we would recommend it to our friends .
We ca n't wait to come back again
"We had a great time enjoyed the great service , and how we were able to walk right to the beach ."
Be sure you get what you paid for!
Front desk refused to change or refund our paid charges .
Hotel did not honor our online booking .
We paid for an oceanview room and were given a room with a view only standing on the balcony !
Would not stay here again - very poor service /
"Beach is accessible , although the stairs a slightly steep ."
"Facilities were very accommodating with BBQ 's , fire pits , and several areas to just relax ."
Great Family Location
Great location with lots to do .
The staff and service were A + .
We will definitely go back !
"asked for a ocean view , did not get but paid full price"
Switch and Bait
Beautiful location for a hotel .
Great Weekend Getaway
Love the fire pits on the hotel grounds that overlook the ocean .
The hotel sits on above a beautiful big sandy beach that is great for family and yet still manages to be romantic .
I would stay for budget visit
The TV was out of order and only 1 set of wash clothes in the room for 2 occupancies .
Always a good 1 night stay.
I like coming here just because I need a clean and close place to sleep in the city .
"Budget-friendly, clean, and comfortable lodging."
But everything else was just fine about our stay .
"But if you would like a clean , comfortable , budget - friendly place to stay when in the Los Angeles Area , the Lincoln Plaza Hotel should work nicely for you ."
"If you have an issue with being served by Asian staff , surrounded by Asian guests , and having people in your hotel speak a different language with each other when they are not speaking with you , then you might have issues staying at this hotel ."
Our room was clean and comfortable .
"The bathroom was small , but everything worked just fine ."
The check - in process was quick and easy .
"The hotel decor is a bit outdated , so it was kind of like stepping back into the 1980's ."
"The hotel is located in the middle of Monterey Park , which is a majority Asian populated city ."
The staff was friendly .
There is a refrigerator in the room for keeping items chilled .
"There was a coffee maker , as well , with both tea and coffee ."
We had a good stay at the Lincoln Plaza Hotel .
We needed extra towels and a visit to the front desk to ask for them had the towels delivered to our room in about five minutes .
Nothing thing was nice worst hotel I had ever in my life
Worst hotel
Not so organized
"The hotel service was terrible , we waited at lobby for almost two hours before they can check us in because they were having trouble finding available rooms , we made the reservations weeks ago and I expect the rooms are ready when we arrive ."
"The location is convenient for my friends since they speak limited English , there are lots of Chinese restaurants and stores within walking distance ."
TERRIBLE HOTEL
"THE STAFFS HAVE NO MANNERS , THE ROOM WAS DIRTY , PILLOWS WERE STING , THE ELEVATOR HAD WATER , WE NEED TO BRING OUR LUGGAGE UP TO GET OUT OF THE DIRTY WATER ."
Cheap Dim Sum
Do n't ...
Everything is decent in size .
"Get there early , like around 11 AM or later after the lunch rush ."
"Like their baked BBQ pork buns , three huge ones on one plate !"
This is probably the cheapest dim sum restaurant in SGV .
"When I say cheapest , not just the price but the portion of the dishes ."
You really get your moneys worth .
A Diamond in the Rough
Bar is a local hangout with a pretty good Band .
"Some staff are friendly , others were not willing to help when needed ."
The entire establishment is dirty and run down .
"The old Aztec Hotel on foothill blvd , ( route 66 ) was a gem , back in its day ."
The property needs a complete overhaul .
"The rooms are very small , which was typical for hotels during that era ."
Unfortunately for the past ten years while the hotel was under poor management it was never maintained .
"92.50 for the smallest , dirtiest , hideous , smoke smelling room I 've ever stayed in ."
Horrible Experience
Management is white trash and extremely rude to customers .
"There is no reason to ever stay in this hotel , it 's garbage and should not be open to the public ."
"I was in town for a quick trip to attend a family event , wanted to save money , be near the event , and get sleep and a shower ."
"Older road-side motel, simple, safe, near traffic noise"
"The hotel staff was friendly , and parking was convenient and included in the room rate ."
"This is a simple , older 2 - story walk - up motel with rooms that face the parking lot , that probably has n't ..."
"Inexpensive, Clean, Quiet, and Accomodating!"
"It was a great deal : close to Dodger stadium for the start , had free wifi and breakfast and the price was better than most we had been seeing in town about this time ."
It was quiet the rooms were very clean ...
My family and I booked this hotel for 5 nights through booking.com while in town for the LA marathon .
"Cool hip hotel next to main street, shopping, and the beach"
Great new hotel with amazing access to shopping and some nightlife - not to mention day time beach trips !
If you get a higher floor you can see the entire boardwalk and down the coast in both directions .
Pretty funny to watch the great HB police case off the night time beach goers !
Good stay
It 's a brand new hotel with most rooms facing the sea .
Really convenient .
"The hotel is right next to the Pacific City , a shopping mall full of good shops and restaurants ."
We had a road side room but the sound proof was very good that we hardly heard any road noises .
We used the free bikes from the hotel to ...
Great experience
Great Room !
Hotel is very Quiet .
"We came to Scottsdale to sight see , service was great , Front desk , house keeping and the Bistro ( Mauro and Ed were great ) went out of there way to make us feel comfortable !"
"Friends and family were all there to attend my daughter 's wedding just a few miles away , their individual attention to each party member made my stay at Salt River especially exceptional ."
"I am a travel concierge , because of their stalwart commitment to service , I will continue to recommend the Courtyard by Marriott to my clients ."
I was not surprised by the excellent service and individual attention which was given to me other wedding guests that stayed at this lovely property .
Lisa and Jean welcomed me and additional family members and ensured that we were well informed regarding shopping opportunities close by .
Marriott is know for its ' excellent service and attention to detail regarding its guests .
Scottsdale's excellent secret
"The accommodations are always immaculately maintained , the front desk staff is always willing to assist regarding any reasonable request ."
We were availed of their free shuttle services within a 3 mile radius throughout our stay .
Well Done !!!
"While the entire hotel staff was amazing , I ca n't begin to bestow the appropriate amount of gratitude and praise Lisa and Jean deserve for their unrivaled professionalism and basic kindness ..."
"First off the staff --- every single staff member --- was helpful , courteous and went out of their way to go extra mile to make sure our stay was great ."
Heather
Hotel excellent in every way!
I 'm a slight germ a phobe so hotel rooms can bother me .
I ca n't say enough good things about this hotel .
I was so comfortable in the room because it was so clean .
"Lastly the little touches like the lemon water at foyer , the milk and cookies at 8 each night and the treasure box for the kids at check out all made the stay extra memorable ."
Second this was the cleanest hotel I 've ever stayed at .
Thank you for a wonderful stay .
The housekeeper even took the time to arrange my kids stuffed animals in fun and creative ways .
"Third , the breakfast was good and had a nice variety ."
Best Hampton Inn
"For that matter , it 's one of the best of its class among all of the hotels we 've known ."
In spite of this - not enough to affect the rating - highly recommended !
Little notes left by the cleaners were a nice touch .
"Our only complaint was that the wireless Internet kept dropping out on checkout the desk clerk apologized and said that the hotel has been trying to solve this problem ( our room also had an ethernet cable , unusual these days , but I had n't brought an adapter for my laptop ) ."
"Staff were friendly and polite , the breakfast good , prices reasonable ."
"This is by far the best Hampton Inn my wife and I have ever stayed in , and we 've been in quite a few ."
"We had a nice , clean suite , quiet , well lit , neatly arranged with a desk / divider between the very comfortable bed and the sitting area ."
Everything is spotlessly clean .
One of my favorite hotels in the WORLD
The beds are soft and cozy .
"The pool is warm and salt - filtered , so no chlorine burning eyes ."
"The staff are friendly , smart , and helpful ."
We love making hot waffles at the complimentary hot breakfast .
We stay here every time we visit Palestine .
You just could n't ask for anything more .
"Also near Applebees , Subway , McDonalds ."
Close to restaurants .
It is near a train track so we did hear ...
It is the newer style Hampton rooms .
Minutes to Texas State RailRoad .
Nice Hotel
"Small , local pizza ."
Try Switch pizza for a local dining experience .
Very large and spacious .
Very nice Hampton .
Walmart nearby .
We had a King suite on the first floor .
Great Place for Wedding Guests to Stay!
I had my wedding at Elmwood Gardens in Palestine and reserved a large block of rooms for my wedding .
In the weeks leading up ...
It was so much fun and the service was great !
The rooms were large and comfortable .

"Staff was extremely personable, helpful, and so friendly"
The staff there was so friendly and nice I wanted to mention their names .

Great Business hotel
I was passing through town and needed to stay the night .
I would recommend .
The Breakfest offerings were better than other hotels and the business center was clean and well stocked .
The front desk clerk was welcoming to a weary traveler and the room was nice and clean .
This hotel was company approved and very inviting .
Beyond Expectations
Highly recommended ...
The hotel features several wonderful amenities .
The hotel looks like it is a brand new hotel in a five star city .
Very classic and elegant features .
"Very friendly hotel staff , very well maintained facilities , easy access to hotel , great breakfast selections and friendly service staff here as well , overall a wonderful experience ."
All rooms are very small .
"Bathroom was very , very clean ."
Bed was comfy but a double when a queen is pretty standard today .
Carpet in our room sorely in need of a cleaning .
Food was good .
Internet sketchy .
Nice Effort with Room to Improve.
Staff are friendly and competent .
The hotel is just average .
The restaurant has a nice vibe .
Wine list a bit too simple .
Great find in Sutter Creek.
The wait staff was very attentive and the food was ...
They have a balcony as well that is sometime open for service .
They have remodeled and opened the place up so that you now can see main street and watch the sights and sounds while dining if you wish .
This establishment took over from the aging but historic Hotel Bellotti .
"Considering its age it was comfortably air conditioned ( 108 degrees outside during our stay ) and the staff , , , , , , just deliteful !"
"Hotel Sutter is an interesting , historic building ."
Really had fun
"The floors arent level and the elevator gives you plenty of time to plan your day while going from floor to floor , but all of this adds th the fact that it s such a cool ..."
Another great dinner
"Great service , friendly staff ."
Had dinner here with friends .
I had the California burger and would recommended it with the sweet potato fries .
Tried the burgers and all of us loved them !
"Breakfast was hot and delicious there is an ice machine , complementary sodas , snacks and fresh baked cookies in the evening ."
Great BB with great views and hospitality
New owners Keith and Denise have done a great job continuing the high level of hospitality and excellence .
"This BB has amazing views from its back porch , complete with mountain views , bunnies and quails ."
Zorro the adorable pooch is well ...
"Abundant snacks , drinks ..."
From the amazing setting and home when you first arrive with the most gracious innkeepers you will ever find to really comfortable rooms with everything you need .
Look no furthur than Chocalate Turtle Bed Breakfast in Corrales .
Looking to travel to the Southwest .
NUMBER 1 BB in New Mexico
The amount of awards they have received are numerous and all really deserved .

My wife and I stayed here at the tail end of our stay in New Mexico .
Relaxation in the high desert
The room and entire BB were very nice and pleasant .
The view of the mountains in the morning is worth getting up at sunrise .
We also enjoyed the standard poodle Zoro who was a nice laid ...
We will stay here again .
Beautiful place for a wedding with one caveat
It was an excellent experience except for one thing which is why I do not give it 5 stars .
One is required to rent the four rooms for at ...
One of the owners was very accommodating about questions and pre-wedding visits .
"The gazebo frames the mountains , and the view is spectacular ."
This was a beautiful place for a small wedding .
